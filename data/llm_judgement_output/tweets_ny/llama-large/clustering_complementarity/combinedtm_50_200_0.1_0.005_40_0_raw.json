The Fitness and Health cluster is the most cohesive, with topics clearly related to exercise, wellness, and weight management. The Personal Development and Motivation cluster includes topics focused on self-improvement, goal setting, and maintaining a positive outlook. The Social Media and Technology cluster is broader and includes topics that reference online activities, digital tools, and modern connectivity, though it's less tightly defined than the first two clusters."
