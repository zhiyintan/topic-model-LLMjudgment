administration official april canada place vancouver british columbia pst folks we be about to start the background briefing on the aid package senior administration official good morning the president president clinton and president yeltsin agree yesterday on series of american initiative to support economic and political reform in russia and it be value at billion before take your question and run through the basic outline of this package want to make few point first this be the maximum that the clinton administration can do with available fund to support russian reform all of the fund have be allocate and appropriate by the congress there be no need for the administration to go back to the congress to fund any of these program all our fiscal year fund currently be available so in effect all of these program can begin tomorrow the second point be that this package be design to support russian reformer all of the initiative in the package be direct at reformer and for their benefit and all have be work out with prior consultation with the russian government third the president be determined that we will deliver on these commitment this year the package be design want to avoid make commitment that we could not meet and we feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitment in front of you fourth would like to note the special importance of trade and investment think it be fair to say that russia capital and technology need throughout the next decade extend well into the hundred of billion of dollar no collection of government can meet those need only the private sector can do so and so the president and president yeltsin agree to make trade and investment major priority in the relationship they also agree that there would be new joint commission on energy and space form head on the side by vice president gore on the russian side by prime minister chernomyrdin and the goal of this effort be to break through the barrier to trade and investment on both side and to promote vastly expand relationship if it would be helpful would be prepared to run down the first page which be summary of assistance and just give you some general background on what these program be will do it quickly and then will be glad to take question the first group of initiative be humanitarian food and medical assistance this be part of our effort which have be underway for several year to provide basic humanitarian grant food assistance so that the russian government can assure there be at least minimal amount of bread on the shelf in the major city that be million in grant that be from food for progress the grant portion of food for progress we will also be continue our grant assistance in medicine and pharmaceutical supply and that be million the second item be concessional food sale as you know the united states have have long term grain relationship with russia it be important to we and it be important to russia that we continue that relationship the president have choose the food for progress program which be concessional loan program the value over the next seven month be million these be concessional term the exact term have not be work out but think it be fair to say there will be grace period on principal of six or seven year and concessional rate thereafter for the life of the deal the third program be collection of private sector support we think this be one of the most important thing we be go to do privatization and the creation of small business be the number one priority of the reform government in moscow and so the president have decide to create russian american enterprise fund capitalize this year at million and the goal of this fund be to make direct loan to small business in russia to take equity position in those business the president have also decide to create privatization fund which would work directly with the russian government in its priority objective of try to convert state enterprise from state own basis to private basis he have also agree the president have also agree to establish eurasia foundation this would be private foundation lead by prominent americans to fund democratization project in russia the fourth grouping you see there in the summary page be democratization itself think it be fair to say that this administration have give new impetus to the goal of pursue democratization in russia you see that we have total of million in program various program the detailed table give an indication of some of the program that we be launch the president be also call for the development of democracy corps which will be an overarch umbrella group to try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public effort now underway from the united states to support reform in russia the fifth program you see be russian office of resettlement this be new initiative create and conceptualize by this administration this be demonstration project what we would like to do be work with the russian military state and other part of the former soviet union we want to make sure that we work out the good way to do that whether it be with russian labor and russian material or use prefab american construction and so we have decide to fund on demonstration basis the construction of housing unit we will be work very closely with the russian military on this and would say that we have long term commitment to this project the sixth area be energy in the environment they be two issue that the president feel strongly about our initial effort will be feasibility study to look into the possibility of enhance their energy production both oil and gas and equally important try to cut down on the leakage in the oil and gas pipeline system which cause so much environmental damage have talk little bit about trade and investment about the new group be create that the vice president will chair on our side secretary ron brown will also be cochaire with deputy prime minister shohkin business development committee which will work in all other sector of the economy trade and investment we be also go to appoint full time investment ombudsman in the american government to work on this problem full time and the point would like to make here be trade and investment in the be every bit as important to draw an analogy as arm reduction be in the and and we just think that in look at this we need to make commitment within our own government to have people work on it senior people on full time basis because it be terribly important you will notice that the united states be go to support russia membership in the gatt russia have have observer status russia have request our support and in fact request our advice in become member of the gatt we think that the long term goal of draw russia into the global economy be paramount very important goal and that be why we be support the membership in the gatt we be also support their access to gsp the generalized system of preferences you will note that ex im have extend million in credit for caterpillar deal in siberia that opic have extend million in credit and loan guarantee for conoco oil project would like to emphasize that we be very close to an agreement between russia and the united states for billion framework facility through the ex im bank that would finance russian purchase of american oil and gas equipment and service we think this be very important development we think we will get there by april which be the opening day of the tokyo conference the conference before take any further question would like to defer to my colleague who will review the security assistance objective with you senior administration official our major unfinished agenda with the russians and with their counterpart in ukraine kazakhstan and belarus be in the area of the safe and secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenal on their territory under the term of the start and start ii agreement recently we complete in moscow three think very important agreement that devote significant chunk of nunn lugar funding million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement program that be for submarine for icbm dismantlement and for bomber dismantlement million the second be million tranche of funding for the construction of facility to store nuclear material remove contribute to the overall design and the early phase of the construction of that storage facility and finally million tranche of money to help in the establishment of monitoring system for the nuclear material as they be withdraw from the weapon system so we add that million total to the extant nunn lugar assistance which have be flow about million for some overall safety improvement for various kind of equipment and safety measure that we have be work out with the russians over the last couple of year so this be an area where we will be go lot more work with not only the russians but with the ukrainians kazhak and belarussians belarus for example have just in the last couple of week receive up to million in fund for safety security and dismantlement program on belarussian territory and this be in the wake of their ratification of start an agreement to accede to npt so we be work very hard with all the party to the lisbon protocol and will continue to work very hard with they and look upon these three recent agreement with russia as very important step in that process the opic fund to be that for the field in kazhakstan and conoco already sign this deal with kazhakstan why do you feel now it be necessary if it be the same one why do you feel it be necessary senior administration official it be not the same deal chevron sign deal with kazhakstan the tenges oil field this be new investment project it be polar light oil development and renovation project and it be be announce today so it be completely new can you tell we more about what be involve senior administration official yes conoco like other american oil company have be search for way to do two thing one to prospect for new oil in siberia west siberia and two to try to get into the business of renovate oil well and renovate pipeline both oil and gas in russia the objective here obviously be to take advantage of the natural resource in russia increase energy production which will in turn increase hard currency revenue which be what russia need so we think this deal be very very good development for russia the russians do as well and it be good for an american company and the american government have play lead role in pull this together through the credit facility in opic and through the loan guarantee so it be to search and also to renovate field that be already there senior administration official that be right on that point should other american company expect to get administration support for such deal or should they now go to the ex im and try to get the money out of the billion senior administration official well as you know ex im be part of the government and various part of the government have be push include the state department and the white house for this deal to be consummate and we think it will and if we arrive at this agreement by april there will be billion in financing available for american company to sell their equipment and sell their service that should take up all of the rest of the deal and their will not be and their will or there will not be support for opic sort of deal such as this conoco senior administration official there be tremendous amount of interest on the part of american oil and gas company to invest in russia we think that the ex im oil and gas facility the billion facility once it be conclude will soak up lot of that interest but think the interest may even extend beyond that and if so the government will respond what be the current year budget cost of that billion agreement should it go forward and be there any current year budget cost senior administration official will have to refer you to ex im for that do not know the detail of that the concessional food sale be there any current year cost to that or be it delay until the year in which the payment be due senior administration official the concessional food sale be from food for progress which be usda program usda have the fund we do not need to go back to the congress to expend those fund there will be hit in the budget would refer you to usda and omb for the detail on that can you talk about the democracy corps and the private sector how many folk be go to be involve in that senior administration official why do not start with the democracy corps first think the administration felt come into office that there be literally thousand of organization private organization in the united states that in one way or another be work at the goal of try to achieve democratization in russia help on farmer to farmer basis and there be literally or government agency that have variety of program in this area and so the administration feel the president feel it be important to try some coherence to the effort and to give some impetus to the effort and so this be presidential initiative it will be head by ambassador tom simons who will soon take up his duty as the coordinator for assistance in the former soviet union and we be very hopeful that we might use this democracy corps not only to draw upon the resource of our own government but the resource of the american private sector and school and community across the nation any kind of commitment yet any kind of word yet on and any new money that need to be appropriate besides the million the president talk about senior administration official the administration be request additional fund in of million what the president have do this weekend be to consult really intensively yesterday with president yeltsin about additional measure the united states could take in some of these area to support reform he will be consult with the congress when he return to washington he will be consult also with the other ally government and we will make decision at that time two question about the billion agricultural money first of all think it be the sort of consensus that what russia do not need be more loan for food so why do you decide to do it that way secondly could you explain agriculture have be stop from make further loan for food because of russia inability to pay how do this fit into that situation senior administration official as you know the united states for long time have be major supplier of grain and food commodity agricultural product to russia think between and we have extend little bit of history here about billion in credit credit guarantee through the commodity credit corporation that be the principal vehicle last year the russian government stop its payment on that program they be now in arrear to we on that program and therefore by law the united states can not continue that program and so the president work with secretary espy and other official in the cabinet look for other way that we could promote american grain sale and think we have two way to do that we have announce today million in grant food assistance through the food for progress program but we do not have sufficient authority to spend million in grant food and so we look for concessional loan program think everybody agree that russia that short term loan program for russia would not make sense now but long term concessional loan program would and that be what this program be it will provide once the final detail be work out for six to seven year grace period on payment of principal and then from year seven through which be the life of the deal it will provide for concessional rate of interest generally around three to four percent and so we believe and the russian government believe this be good deal for they because it will avoid the imperative of early payment and put they into the out year but it will also continue this very important grain relationship which be important for they and it be important for the american farm community gather from what you say that this could make it explicit the russians failure to pay the interest on ecc loan do not in any way affect this kind of loan go through be that right senior administration official let be explicit about that we be prevent under the law to from continue the commodity credit corporation short term credit program because of russia arrearage to the united states all of you know about those arrearage they total about think around million usda can give you an exact figure so having take that into consideration and want to preserve american market share and long term grain relationship want to respond to specific request from the russian government for major food assistance know that we could not take it from the grant program because we do not have sufficient authority there we look at food for progress which be program we have use to great effect in other part of the world and we consult with the russian government and arrive at this solution think the russians be pleased because it provide they with the food but also give they little bit of relief on the short term payment where do those fund actually come from senior administration official they come from the food for progress program which be program under usda authority usda have the authority to spend these fund we do not need to go back to the congress for these fund and want the billion package comprise fund that have already be allocate and appropriate by the congress the administration can begin to spend these monie tomorrow and it be very important in our eye that we expend all the fund this year that we meet these commitment and we be confident we will be able to do so how do you arrive at the figure of million do that max out that program or do you actually have range from to senior administration official there be reason for it the reason be that the russian government tell we that be about the amount of grain that they need between now and harvest time and so the idea be that we would begin the shipment probably million per month from now until the harvest in the autumn at which time russia will not require the same level of food import from the west would imagine there be go to be some considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other republic because of the size and the scope of this with russia have you give any consideration to advance negotiation for the same kind of project with the ukraine with georgia with some of the other republic senior administration official yes we be very conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extend american support to the other country of the former soviet union we have tell ourselves and we have plan that in the area of technical assistance the grant technical assistance that you see roughly percent of the funding will go to russia and roughly percent to the other country in the area of food sale we have be active with ukraine in grant food assistance with georgia and armenia we will continue that and think it be fair to say that after this summit we will go back and look at all of our program with the other country to ensure that they be adequate and they be productive and they be hard hit have anything happen at the summit to lead american energy company and other company to believe that russia be go to be more user friendly toward they in term of tax legality bureaucracy senior administration official well one of our primary objective come into this summit be to highlight not only the economic agenda but also trade and investment and would like to refer to the point make at the beginning we be convinced in talk about this problem the problem of how to support russia long term we be convinced that no collection of western government have the financial resource over the next decade to fuel the continuation of reform that only the private sector can do that we look at our own society and we see tremendous capability in resource in the oil and gas sector it be very good match with what the russians need now which be financial investment in the exist oil and gas well and pipeline and new technology and new capital to finance new production that be what the russian government have tell we it want to do and so that be why we have make such major emphasis on it that be why trade and investment be prominent issue on the first day of these talk and in fact figure prominently last night in the meeting between president yeltsin and president clinton and we be hope that together we might send strong signal to the american business community that we support their effort to invest in russia that the united states through ex and opec and the department of commerce will be there to support they my question be be yeltsin in any position to deliver on make russia more senior administration official we think he be would note that president yeltsin prime minister mr chernomyrdin work for year in the russian oil and gas sector he will now chair high level commission with the vice president vice president gore to try to break through the barrier that currently exist to western investment in the oil and gas sector we believe we have commitment to make that committee an important committee and we be look forward to the work what type of mechanism be already in place to administer the private sector portion of the program and will the be directly involve in the tail end of distribution of the actual fund or be the money simply turn over to the russian government for distribution at their will senior administration official be you talk about the variety of program list here it depend on the program itself in most case though we be either work through americanbo or american government agency to ensure that the money obviously be well spend that the money get to the intend source that be an obligation we have to the congress to ensure the money be well spend and that we can account for the money we have do that in the last couple of month intensively and we will continue to do it for each of these program but they be all quite different for instance in the area of grant food and medical assistance for grant food it be carry out through usda and usda account for the delivery of the food for grant medical assistance we have be work through project hope which be private organization for the housing for instance the resettlement of russian officer we will be work with group of americanbo on some of the democratization project we be work directly with russian private individual and private foundation we be work with journalist in russia on media project that you may have notice so we literally have here to different activity under all these rubric and they be all go to be carry out in slightly different way some directly with the russian government some with russian citizen the jackson vanik restriction that remain and on the cocom restriction that remain can you tell we what the president have to do on that senior administration official well as george note yesterday president yeltsin raise these as irritant in the relationship the president have note that think it be fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we return to washington and look at both of these question and we will get back to the russian government you be not prepared for these question when you get here senior administration official we be prepare for these question we have look at they but we be not prepared to make quick decision this weekend they require let just explain particularly on jackson vanik they require consultation with the congress they require consultation with the american jewish community and we be very sensitive to those concern and so we will want to go back and talk to they before we take any action be this package design so that you will not have to go to congress for anything at this point senior administration official as say at the beginning the advantage of this particular package be that all the fund have be allocate and appropriate by the congress so the administration will not have to go back to the congress to seek any additional authority to fund any of these effort in effect they can all begin tomorrow and know that many of the agency responsible for these project will begin tomorrow and that be the advantage of this particular initiative if this as the president say be long term long haul thing and member of congress be at this moment head for moscow why be not you talk about go to congress and suggest to the president of russia that you be prepared to go to congress for various thing senior administration official think we have be clear about that the president be discuss this weekend with president yeltsin some additional idea that we have for american funding of additional project and idea that he have we have major congressional delegation that leave last night head by representative gephardt and we will want to consult with that delegation and other member of congress before do anything and we will also want to consult with our ally so that be where it stand now we have be tell repeatedly that number of these item represent different or new way of spend the money already appropriate could you just tick off which of these item represent reprogramme or at least spend money in way that it be not previously set to be senior administration official think that we have say that these be all project that either congress have allocate money for through the freedom support act there be some fund that be leave over from and this administration take office and have some new idea about how the fund might be expend we do not use just the freedom support act fund or the fund we go into some of the agency allocation ex im opic and usda and try to look for creative way to further our program and example of that be the food for progress concessional loan we have hit brick wall with another type of funding through usda we could not go forward legally and so we look for more creative way to ensure continued american market share and ensure continued grain sale and we think we find it where for example be you get the money for this russian officer resettlement senior administration official that be from the freedom support act fund in other word all of the money be be directly spend in new way so to speak senior administration official most of the grant project that you see if you look at the general chart the second chart it be break down into grant and credit and if you look under grant the technical cooperation project that total million that be almost all freedom support act funding little bit of it be leftover fund from fiscal year the nunn lugar fund of course you know about the legislative history of those fund cooperation senior administration official fromy do not have the exact figure it be not considerable figure could you tell we please have anything happen here this weekend that will break the log jam between ukraine and russia over start for start and ii as result of what be happen here senior administration official both president president yeltsin and president clinton will be discuss this issue this morning in fact we have not yet get to security and arm control related issue that will be this morning session know that president clinton will be very strongly reinforce that this be top priority for we we have be talk to the russians and the ukrainians over the last couple of week about way that we might help to facilitate the discussion between they up to this point this have be very important negotiation that be be go on essentially between moscow and kiev and we be at the point now of essentially discuss with they if there be way that we could contribute but in term of what be come out of this weekend do not yet know in couple hour we will know just follow up on the financing here be any of this rob peter to pay boris since it be all current year appropriation have you take it from anyplace that be be earmark and put it into this fund senior administration official there be smoke and mirror here and think it be an important point to note we could have give you page of assistance number that include out year funding we be go to make long term commitment to many of these project for instance the enterprise fund the privatization effort the housing effort and we have already talk to the russians about our long term commitment we could have put in really big number and this could have be big package but we want to make point this package bey it be fund that we have and we be go to do what we say we be go to do and the president feel very strongly about that in the past there be legacy that the western government the combination of government put up large budget figure and for any number of reason we be not able to meet they we be determine and the president be determine to carry out every single program in this package and we will do it but we do have long term commitment and that be part of the discussion on economic this weekend we be look for russian idea on what it be we can do to most effectively support reform and we have tell they that we do have commitment on some of these program beyond this fiscal year take it way from any senior administration official no we have not okay the question be have we reprogramme any of these fund so have we take it from other country to pay for program in russia the answer be no we have not do so in term of funding there be no available monie leave and you simply find creative way to find money somewhere else do not that in fact support the theory senior administration official not at all do not think it do that be particular example and the example be grain sale the commodity credit corporation credit guarantee program be short term loan that russia have to pay back within to month you all know about russia debt problem and russia be unable to meet those commitment so we look for way to do two thing to meet russia requirement for grain they be net grain importer on massive scale and also meet our objective of make sure that the american farmer have chance to sell their product to russia and we simply look for another way to finance that and we have legislative authority to do it this program have be successful in other area we have not try it before in the former soviet union but we think we should now be not this really the bush clinton aid package for russia since these fund be really first derive by initiative put forward by president bush senior administration official no do not think that be fair characterization lot of these fund be appropriate by the congress be in this administration take office and inherit some obligation that the bush administration have make but we have long six to seven week review of this program we decide to meet the commitment that have be make by the previous administration but we have go well beyond they in fund the enterprise fund which be just an idea but the idea have not be fill out with program there be no number attach to it in group together some project and try to make they into coherent whole in the privatization effort would say be another clinton initiative far we listen to the russian government and listen to the russian military who tell we that the resettlement of their officer be important to they for political and economic and social reason and president clinton have respond to that and we be make long term commitment that beyond this demonstration project we be go to figure out way to do much more in try to settle those officer would also say that the president have give impetus to all of we in the agency to think much more broadly about what it be we can do on democratization because there we have some experience and some comparative advantage that lend itself to the russian experience and in call for the creation of democracy corps which be another new initiative we be hopeful that we can take the resource of the private sector as well as the american government to achieve that objective so would not characterize it that way at all and as most of you know be career civil servant be in the last administration be very familiar with what the last administration do and would characterize this as clinton assistance package for russia there be be lot of criticism that aid in the past have not get to the people be there anything in this outside of the ombudsman that will guarantee that this money will not just disappear because it be be administer by the russian government senior administration official think that know that the president and other senior official of our government be concerned that american money be spend wisely and that it get to the source that it be intend for which it be intend and so we be go to take great care aid and the state department will take great care in make sure that the fund be expend properly and that they be reach their source would not that this package be not simply package of support solely to the russian government some of these project especially in democratization and exchange be go to be work out directly with russian private individual with business the private enterprise support be another example of that senior administration official if could just add word on this point with regard to the ssd relate program one area that we have be look at very very closely be consideration of actually use russian firm in subcontract for these kind of program they would be work very closely of course with the american firm who would be the prime contractor but this be fine example think of more of imaginative and flexible approach toward get some of that funding down to the grassroots level down to the ground in russia but at the same time ensure that it be spend efficiently and for the purpose for which it be intend when would the democracy corps start exactly when do you see this happen how would get it off the ground senior administration official well the president be today call for the creation of democracy corps think it be fair to say that we be go to work out its framework over the next couple of week ambassador simons take up his duty on may but in effect we have already start because over the last couple of week the administration have begin to reach out to people in the private sector who have come to we ask we that we will be helpful we have also try to kind of coordinate in much more effective way the activity of our own government we do have or agency that be active in russia in one way or another we think it make sense to draw they together and to focus their effort excuse how much of this billion will actually be spend in the united states by american make good senior administration official do not have any figure for you now but perhaps we could try to work something up in the next couple of day on that this figure be large than the figure that have be in the press do this program grow yesterday as result of the discussion or have we just be that far off the mark senior administration official no think unfortunately the press have be little bit off the mark and be sorry to say that no this package president clinton put we to work about seven week ago on this package and he be brief intensively on this he contribute lot of the intellectual leadership in this package he contribute lot of the idea in the package and think it be fair to say that we have this rough package work out about two week ago we have be refine it ever since we spend couple of day last week go over it with the russian government both the embassy in washington and the government in moscow through our own embassy and so it be be evolve but this particular package have be together for about two week where be yeltsin input into this then there be so much talk before about the president want to get yeltsin view about specifically what be need and so forth be that in the out year senior administration official no it be both president yeltsin have on several occasion tell we for instance that support for the creation of private business be important important and that first and foremost the effort to privatize the state industry be important to they and so what we do be to try to make those the centerpiece of our technical assistance part the package we listen to he on the privatization effort we have be work with the russian government for month on this try to work out all the detail so the russian government on most of these program be involve every step of the way but let get at the other part of your question the president be also use this weekend to talk about broad set of initiative that we might undertake and we be look for his idea the president have bring his own idea to the table for instance on energy and the environment and in housing but we be look for russian idea not we need to consult with the congress and we need to consult with the other ally government that be also active there be essentially nothing that happen in the last day and half that measurably alter the package that you come in with senior administration official this particular package as say be work out and be ready about two week ago we have since then consult with the russian government on the final stage of its development and so this weekend we have primarily talk about future about what more the united states and other western country can do to support reform in russia which be our base objective here notice that you that money appropriate what about job training for worker who be displace by privatization senior administration official you be right we have program to train russian young russians in banking and financial service in the united states part of the housing initiative it be not just to build housing unit it be to retrain russian officer who be retire into other profession money for job training for worker whose job be disappear because of privatization senior administration official we have not yet allocate any money for that why not of the million be go to build housing unit be not that lot of money per unit give what the western dollar will buy in the former soviet union senior administration official if you want to do housing the right way it be not just the building the framework of house you have get to think about all the utility you have get to think about the purchase of land you have get to think about sewage and gas and electricity and so forth and it be also retrain it be not enough to put retire an officer come out of riga or tallin or vilnius in house in western russia we think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officer as well this be respond to request from the russian government of the million will go to retrain senior administration official that be right be you talk about apartment building or single senior administration official we be talk about single individual dwelling you be say that only family will be serve by this senior administration official what want to think point out early this be demonstration project what we do not want to do give the experience that the germans and the turks and the italians have have in build housing in western russian we do not want to leap into it with huge amount of money what we want to do be work over the next couple of month and try to figure out with american organization in the private sector the good way to get this job do note that we have long term commitment to that and so would expect that we would put lot more money into this in the future but we want to do it wisely we want to spend the money wisely what be it about this program that convince you that it will protect russia reform and that russia will be in position to may back the money they be suppose to pay back especially consider their other debt problem senior administration official well look think it be important to note that the united states on its own do not have the capability to fuel continuation of russian reform it be get to be collective western effort and we be look to our ally to do more as well but beyond that it be really what the russians do that be go to decide the fate of reform we can simply play role and we feel we have an obligation to do so which be consistent with our national interest do the president say that the value of the contribution be that it would create security and prosperity for the united states so what be it about this program that do this senior administration official think you have to go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward russia and that be we want to do everything we can to support the continuation of reform we be convinced that if reformer stay in power then we will be able to continue the drawdown of nuclear force foreign policy cooperation and economic interaction which be the three benefit to the united states from reform in russia so it be not simple question you can not just say that this program be the answer it be long term question and we have to make long term commitment to it and then on the question of russia ability to repay what convince you they will be able to pay seven to year from now senior administration official well

and international security rimsat be consider an appropriate topic because the company be use russian launcher and satellite think it also help that his daughter be grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently begin when matt neilson go to tonga who happen to be big tv fan matt buy the king satellite dish which the king think be really nifty since tonga havenp of about million his majesty ask if there be any way to make money off this matt think there probably be so at his suggestion tonga apply for geosynchronous satellite slot while this be not entirely off the wall it be very unusual see as tonga be tiny kingdom with no space program and be lot of slot the whole thing be debate in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who be apparently respected space lawyer write several opinion support tonga case eventually tonga end up with slot range from to slot be designate by the longitude over which they reside accord to sternberg four of these from to be the good in the world because they be excellently place for communication between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat be form to use these slot it be officially form in nevis as tax haven they try for few year to raise fund in the west however to fill slot with western satellite launch on western launcher would have cost approximately billion it be not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of use russian hardware they begin negotiate withlavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describe operate in moscow in such harsh term that do not think will visit there for long time besides significant lack of creature comfort he be not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper document and license that indicate they be the only one who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arrange deal withlavkosmos for satellite at cost of million howeverlavkosmos lose favor after the coup sternberg say that this be because they be basically bunch of kgb operative who go to trade show and pick up lot of brochure sincelavkosmos be out of power he have to renegotiate the deal with the new authority he again describe life in moscow hotel in rather unfavorable term eventually he work out deal and on dec he meet with koptev who head the russian

rimsat the next step be to meet with the builder of the hardware npo applied mechanics npo pm to use their acronym this organization be locate in siberia can not figure out how to spell the town need

very much like midwesterner at this point there be some comment from the audience that agree with his opinion on both siberian and midwesterner sternberg have lot of good thing to say about npo pm his company be apparently lookng for million to invest in the firm to become partner it apparently cost the russians about million to build satellite that would sell for million in the west if you want to give they specification they will build you satellite for the particular satellite that rimsat will be use cost run about per transponder year this compare to in the they can sell their time for about million compare to million in the rimsat will launch their satellite on protons to get the good price they buy in bulk they have the right to twelve launch so if any of you need lift can give you their address the first launch be schedule for october and they be get one use satellite from the russians which be be move into place now tidbit sternberg say this kind of thing have to be do by

in their coffer and replace the rest with the equivalent value in ruble to get around this rimsat pay their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pay their contractor with foreign currency so that the only the contractor get swindle by the government one of the big problem rimsat have have be stonewall by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently buy three of the same type of satellite which be rather reassuring the big worry most people have about russian satellite be the primitive technology and short lifetime the old gorizont horizon satellite have lifetime of about year while the more modern express satellite compare well with western technology and last about year while this be much short than year for western satellite sternberg downplay the

they start to smash the door on the lock side first with an axe and then with crowbar when the door give way they tear it off its hinge sasha hit one of they with the axe the axe fly out of his hand they also have axis crowbar pipe and special rod make from armature shaft one of they hit my father in the head the pressure from the mob be immense when we retreat into the room one of they hit my

several of the bandit in the head and in the eye all that go on but they the injure one fall back and other come to take their place there be many of they the door fall down at an angle the mob try to remove the door so as to go into the second room and to continue to finish we off father bring skewer and give they to sasha and we fly at they when we see father bleed his face be cover with blood he have be wound in the head and his whole face be bloody we just throw ourselves on they when we see that we throw ourselves at the mob and drive back the one in the hall drive they down to the third floor we come out on the landing but group of the bandit remain in one of the room they be smash all the furniture in there having close the door behind they we start tear the door off to chase away the remain one or finish they then man an impose man of about an azerbaijani come in when he be come in father fall down and mother fly to he and start to cry out jump out onto the balcony and start call an ambulance but then the mob start throw stone through the window of our veranda and kitchen we live on the fourth floor and no one come go into the room it seem to that this man be the leader of the group he be respectably dress in hat and trench coat with fur collar and he address my mother in azerbaijani what be with you woman why be you shout what happen why be you shout like that she say what do you mean what happen you kill somebody my father be musician he play the clarinet he play at many wedding armenian and azerbaijani he play for many year everyone know he mother say the

the to people who be in the other room open the door and start run out we chase after they but they run away that man leave too as we be later tell downstair one of they tell the other do not know if it be from fright or what tell they that we have firearm even though we only fight with hammer and an axe we race to father and start call an ambulance the ambulance never come although we wait for it all evening and all through the night somewhere around midnight about policeman come they inform we they be have our condolence they tell we not to touch anything and leave father lie in the room so we stay home each of we take hammer and knife we sit at home well we say if they descend on we again we will defend ourselves somewhere around one clock in the morning two people come from the sumgait procuracy investigator they say leave everything just how it be we be come back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything then people come from the republic procuracy too but no one help we take father away the morning come and the neighbor arrive we want to take father away somehow we call the procuracy and the police couple of time but no one come we call an ambulance and nobody come then one of the neighbor say that the bandit be come to our place again and we should hide we secure the door somehow or other we leave father in the room and go up to the neighbor the excess begin again in the morning the bandit come in several vehicleil panel truck and throw themselves out of the vehicle like land force near the center of town our building be locate right there crowd form then they start fight with the soldier then in buildings and that be next to the airline ticket office they start break into armenian apartment destroy property and steal the armenians be not at home they have manage to flee and hide somewhere and again they pour in the direction of our building they be shout that there be some armenians leave on the fourth floor mean we they be up there still up there let us go kill they they break up all the furniture remain in the two room throw it outside and burn it in large fire we be hide one floor up something heavy fall sasha throw himself toward the door shout that it be probably father they have throw father be defile the corpse probably throw it in the fire go to burn it hear it and the sound be kind of hollow and say no that be from some of the furniture mother and pounce on sasha and stop he somehow and calm he down the mob leave somewhere around eight clock they smash open the door and go into the apartment of the neighbor across from we they be also armenians they have leave for another city the father of the neighbor who be conceal we come and say be you crazy why be you hide armenians do not you now they be check all the apartment they could kill you and they and to we come on leave this apartment we go down to the third floor to some other neighbor at first the man do not want to let we in but then one of his son ask he and he relent we stay there until eleven clock at night we hear the sound of motor the neighbor say that it be armored personnel carrier we go downstairs there be light on in the room where we leave father in the other room as we find out later all the chandelier have be tear down they leave only one bulb the bulb be burn which probably be signal they have agree on because there be light burn in every apartment in our microdistrict where there have be pogrom with the help of the soldier we make it to the city party committee and be save our salvation my mother my brother and mine wa purely accidental because as we later find out from the neighbor someone in the crowd shout that we have firearm up there well we fight but we be only able to save mother we could not save father we inflict many injury on the bandit some of they serious but other come to take their place we be also wound there be blood and we be scratch all over we get our share it be miracle we survive we be save by miracle and the troop and if troop have not come to sumgait the slaughter would have be even great probably all the armenians would have be victim of the genocide through an acquaintance at the city party committee be able to contact the leadership of the military unit that be bring into the city and at their order we be assign special people to accompany we expert we go to pick up father corpse we take it to the morgue this be about two clock in the morning it be already march it be rain very hard and it be quite cold and we be wear only our suit when my brother and carry father into the morgue we see the burned and disfigured corpse there be about six burn people in there and the small corpse of burn child it be gruesome suffer tremendous shock there be about ten people there but the doctor on duty say that because of the number they be be take to baku there be woman corpse there too she have be well there be part of body there hack off part of woman body it be something terrible the morgue be guard by the landing force the child that have be kill be only ten or twelve year old it be impossible man there too several man you could not tell anything because their face be disfigure they be in such awful condition now two and half month have pass every day recall with horror what happen in the city of sumgait every day my father and the death of my father and how we fight and the people sorrow and especially the morgue still want to say that year have pass since soviet power be establish and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happen in sumgait it will go down in history be particularly surprised that the mob be not even afraid of the troop they even fight the soldier many soldier be wound the mob throw fuel mixture onto the armored personnel carrier set they on fire they be not afraid they be so sure of their impunity that they attack our troop see the clash on february near the airline ticket office right across from our building and that mob be fight with the soldier the inhabitant of some of the building also azerbaijanis throw rock at the soldier from window balcony even cinder block and glass tank they be not afraid of they say they be sure of their impunity when we be at the neighbor and when they be rob home near the airline ticket armenian apartment and burning home and they tell that they know that they be be burn during those day no one from the police department come to anyone aid no one come to help we either to our home even though perhaps they could have come and save we as we later find out the mob be give free vodka and drug near the bus station rock be distribute in all part of town to be throw and use in fighting so think all of it be arrange in advance they even know in which building and apartment the armenians live on which floor they have list the bandit you can tell that the operation be plan in advance thank of course to our troop to the country leadership and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for help we thank to the russian people because the majority of the troop be russians and the troop suffer loss too want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenians and in the name of all sumgait armenians for come in time and avert terrible thing bad would have happen if that mob have not be stop on time at present an investigation be be conduct on the part of the ussr procuracy want to say that those bandit should receive the severe possible punishment because if they do not the tragedy the genocide could happen again everyone should see that the most severe punishment be mete out for such deed very many bandit and harden hooligan take part in the unrest in the mass disturbance the mob be huge at present not all of they have be catch very few of they have be think judge by the newspaper report there be around people near our building alone that be how many people take part in the pogrom of our building all in all they should all receive the most severe punishment so that other see that retribution await those who perform such act may yerevan reference the

dash toward the soldier one of the soldier can not manage to get away they start stomp on he with their foot everyone kick he become ill and go home and explain in general term that horrible thing be go on out there can not speak well they have probably kill that soldier the way that crowd be if each of they kick he just once they take his club away from he and start to beat he with it but it be far away and could not see if he get up and leave or not become terrified and go home and sayyuda do not go anywhere stay at our place because if you go out they could kill you or then the crowd run

come who send you here no one want you here have not you kill people people yet what be you do here one of the soldier say do not scream at we we be muslims but we be not from the sumgait police they call in from daghestan so at that point the daghestan police be there when we get to the police precinct there be an awful lot of police there there be soldier police with dog ambulance fireman do not know maybe they be wait for people to bring they the goner and the seriously injure to treat they there in the police precinct do not know what they be there for there be also doctor from baku there they examineyuda and and say these woman need to go to the maternity home but we do not know what to do with the rest so they take we and lose contact with my parent my boss everyone my boss say do not worry will find you no matter where you be no matter what happen we go to the hospital there we be examine by department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva think her name be she examine we the ambulance be from baku figure out that the sumgait ambulance have not do anything they do not respond to any call people call and neither the police nor the ambulance show any sign of life that doctor look over and could tell from her behavior that something very good have happen for she become quite glad even think to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad be wrong she look over and say now why be you suffer so you do not know what your people have be do your people do even bad thing and think great have to deal with she and feel so bad think why do not just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like she here be in this condition and be tell about something that our people do just do not have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours have not already do stay there then they bring in another woman ira she be marry and she be rape in her own apartment too there be three of we irayuda and the next morning they takeyuda and ira away they do not do anything to help we this be in the old maternity home in the combine block they do not do anything more than examine that be it do not want any shot or tranquilizer nothing what shot could have calm down do not even want to look at they lie in the ward either it just work out that way or they do it on pur pose but be alone be alone even though the ward be pack that same evening woman come by and ask what be wrong with that my face be disfigure she ask what have happen to and say well to ask your brother what happen there be no point in ask your brother can well explain what happen she fall into faint all the doctor throw themselves at she and the doctor categorically forbid anyone to come into my ward then people from work come to see my boss his daughter they bring clothing because be literally naked the only thing have on be dress but the woman who give it to be very short and the dress be way up above my knee and the woman orderly say can not believe you put on such short dress who be you show off your leg to here go back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something people from work come and bring something in sack apple think three or four pound but could not take they have become so weak that it be just embarrassing say that could not take the apple and really do not have any appetite no one have to bring anything some woman take the sack and oh yes then hear that the head doctor tell nurse that my medical history should be hide or tear up completely so that no one would know that be an armenian maybe they would not figure it out from look at so they must have be think that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be bad or perhaps someone be outside on the street do not know in any case do not sleep wink that night the next morning they pick up whole police detail put in bus and off we go do not even know where they be take they take to the club where the troop be the very one be in that ill fate evening get off the bus near the city party committee there be great many troop tank armored personnel carrier the whole scene be terrible see few people know there and that calm little have already think that be the only one leave so there be five or six of we leave in sumgait after that night still do not know what happen to my parent they do not come to see in the hospital and my boss tell that everything be fine do not know whether to believe he or not maybe he be just try to calm down maybe something happen on the way then go to the club and see lot of people know they all know one another they be all kiss each other and ask what happen what go on two day later they come to see from work they be there all the time each day they come show interest and be constantly bring money they do everything they could of course be most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleague who do not lose his presence of mind and who do not change his opinion neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happen he constantly take an interest sincere interest from the heart then about two day later the secretary of the party committee come not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours be part of comrade kerimov very important figure in our town he make arrangement with the emergency medical personnel to take away because if sit down by myself could not get up or lie down again there be something wrong with my lung it be hard to breathe they examine there several time there lie be several doctor they all think that that it must just be when be in the maternity home even ask make it point of insist that they take to the trauma section because feel so awful there be no way something inside be not break my rib well they take there and take ray and say that everything be fine there be emergency medical worker on duty in the club the mother of one of marina friend be there she be the head doctor at the sumgait children clinic they have every kind of antifever agent in the world which be exactly what need at that moment think say that be have great difficulty breathing could not seem to get enough air something be wrong with they put tight bandage around my chest and waist later overhear some people say that have be cut all over think they just see be all bandage up and decide that my breast and face have be cut but be not cut they take we to thehimik boarding house we live there long time soon appear representative they be agitate at first people would not talk to they and drive they off one of the armenian woman shout we demand that seidov come the response be it be seidov who send we seidov be the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers the woman say we will only see seidov daughter have she come here we will do the same thing to she that they do to our daughter and then we will deal with you agitator and so on more of they say have seidov himself come this go on day in day out the agitator keep come and come this drive we out of our wit then people gradually start depart for yerevan because they realize it be senseless to stay everything get on our nerve the smell the small child there be child at the sk club child who have literally just come out of the maternity home what be they do in club that do not even have run water all the time at first we have to pay someone tell we that they would bring we food for free the child be ill everything stank there well imagine about people in small movie theater with seating for no more than you could not sit or lie down it be impossible to even move the stench be awful even the small infant take ill overnight there hear that they be arrive seriously ill in yerevan the infant they have to be wash they have to be bathe not to mention that we the adult be ill and need care people be faint right and leave just do not know everyone be cry everyone only the young people the man somehow manage to keep it together but the woman be in constant state of panic it seem to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seem clear that we have be gather together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there would not be single armenian left then people go up to the attic do not see they only hear they because be lie down and could not get up lay right on the stage we have some room there apparently they catch two people with either oil or gas think they want to burn the theater maybe someone see they do not be in no condition to open my eye everyone be suspicious of everyone else they would ask be not you an azerbaijani think see you somewhere think you be an azerbaijani they lead out all the man and start let they back in by check their passport relative might be cover for each other half of the people do not have any document there be people who have run out of their home in nothing but pair of pant and slipper or wear just shirt not like they should have with their id so on the on sunday think the police do nothing to help we on monday everything resume where it have leave off on block they do not spare soul there not child not pregnant woman nobody they kill they burn they hack with axis just everything possible they murder the melkumian family whom know my mother work with they their daughter in law go to school with my old sister they be brutally murder only the two daughter in law survive by miracle one be able to save herself she run away the neighbor would not take she in so she run about the building until she find refuge she be pregnant and have two small child this all continue on monday in block on the when the troop be already in the city they murder people they overturn automobile and they burn entire family they say they do not even know for sure if the people be armenians or not hear that the lezgins suffer too be not sure myself do not see any lezgin who have be injure they burn car so it be very difficult now to say exactly who die and who do not it be very difficult to identify the corpse or rather what remain of the corpse after they be douse in gasoline and burn it be all very hard to imagine of course hear that many people disappear without trace from the btz plant two people include woman who work the night shift aunt razmella who also live in microdistrict they be stop bus between baku and sumgait in the evening people who have be visit baku be return to sumgait and people from baku be go home from sumgait and there be student too they be simply savagely murder they be stop the bus the driver immediately do what they be tell because there be just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people they stop the bus drag the armenians out and kill they on the spot do not see it myself but hear that they put they all in pile so as to burn they later it be hard to discern from the corpse well you can not call they corpse you have to figure out from the ashe who it be hear that two fellow save two woman one student ira if be not mistaken she be in the hospital long time after that and she still can not figure out who save she she be also brutally rape and beat and throw onto pile of corpse the fellow pull she out of that whole pile of corpse put his coat on she take she into his arm and carry she to the city still can not imagine how he manage to do that hear that from engels grigorian he know she apparently well lot of people go to that hospital anyway she be in the hospital and singe song in armenian and they write the word down and think he still have that piece of paper because he say that lot of people now have that song the one she sing in the hospital where she lie in such bad shape they could not find the guy who save she he leave she in someone apartment and call the ambulance she be in such awful shape that probably like she could not remember anyone face think that know one of the people who break into our house maybe have talk with he once but receive so many blow everything be just knock out of my head can not remember to this day who he be then it seem see the secretary of the directorate party organization where marina work she go to school and work she go to night school at azi and work by day at thehimzashchita construction and installation administration be the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often meet with the secretary of party and komsomol organization we have joint meeting know they all have even talk with they and he know be from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it become obvious that many of those people be azerbaijanis bear in armenia they take to various police station to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy get involve in the case and iden tifie the photograph of people who could more or less recognize they show the people who be in our apartment they be work on our case but can not even recognize they although it be prove that they be the one they be process it somehow they tell that they know that someone hold by the arm and someone else hold by the leg when they be drag there be someone else in our apartment who do not even touch he just steal blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of they as much as have hear about they and see they they be all from kafan the secretary of the party organization be name najaf najafzayev he be there when everything start it must have be he because do not recognize anyone else in the crowd whom know besides he all the more since tell he listen you do something because you know he turn away and go toward the bedroom where marina be well you could not see marina anyway there be such noisy confusion of people that you could not make out anyone all of it fly right out of my head and then gradually become myself again at the city party committee there be military people there tell they what go on and they write it all down tell they his name on march the secretary of our first trust party organization the one we be part of come to see we his name be najafzayev tell mamma if he be here despite the fact that give his name it mean that either his alibi have be confirm or probably that they think be crazy not responsible for my word he say what do they do to you how awful myself hide an armenian family then after some time go by he come back again and say something entirely different be not at home my family and go to baku say marina what be he say he say something totally different before after that do not go to see our procurator our case be be handle by procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov tell thatzayev case have just get to he and there be so name involve what be they do withzayev do he prove his alibi or not they just think that since be hit in the head can not say anything for sure whether it be he or not it will be an insult if he be in our apartment and do not have to pay for it but at the same time be afraid to say be hundred percent sure that it be he because no mat ter who name they tell no you be wrong he do not do that that one be not there all the face have get mixed up in my mind who do what exactly can not say when they take outside there be whole crowd there but do not see it because have my eye close all the time it seem to that always get it because of my eye people be always hassle for some reason it always seem to that my eye be responsible when they be beat my face think they be try to put my eye out so have my eye close they take outside and start to beat young guy hold my arm he work at the btz plant and right nearby across the road from we block be where all this be go on right

not come over he just look and then go into the dormitory while after it be all over people start make announcement in town say that investigator have be summon that guy go and tell they everything now they have catch he everything be be prove now evidently they have be beat he do not know what they be do with they over there but he himself say that he be work the night shift at the plant some young guy come to the plant and say everyone who want to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten that be it he say the one who want to go this be at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday night it be at night they be at the sauna together and he say what do you mean do you understand what you be say the other be silent probably in their heart they be think be go to go but they do not say anything to one another he say that he think it important to to go because he have hear lot about what have happen in kafan that they have kill their azerbaijani sister their mother burn village and all of that that guy be also bear in kafan that be certain and marina say that the secretary of the party organization be from armenia too from have participate in the investigation couple of time be satisfied with they thus far they summon we and ask about what happen and every word say be record meet some guy there by the way he be an armenian say that he be in our apartment but what he do do not know his last name be grigorian eduard grigorian he from sumgait from microdistrict he be sentence think to five year not his first time his mother be russian meet with he at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb they take we there and show photograph there be so many photograph think they even photograph those people who be catch at curfew and have get they all confused say the face be about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasp but he could take that coat off and burn it somewhere and it would be like look for needle in haystack well this guy grigorian say he be in our apartment but he be so light complect that he look like lezgin do not know what he do can not remember maybe he beat or rape but he be in our apartment at the kgb he start ask plead with there be no need for this all this stuff look in the eye you be like sister to take look at he and think my god heaven forbid that should have brother like you but they be satisfied with my response because say everything without great certainty be there with mamma thenyuda come in but when she come in she get sick immediately she want to kill he she crawl over the table at he she recognize he when she come toyuda be lie on the balcony the mob throw she there and all of they run into the bedroom we have all kind of box with dish in they the dowry for all three sister they steal everything in the apartment leave only small thing at that momentyuda come to and start remember everything well see the face hear the voice two people be say they could burn the apartment another say why burn the apartment when have get three kid and no place to live so this guy be in temporary housing he do not have anywhere to live he be from sumgait they be sure that they would get the apartment besides the neighbor be azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijanis that be what they say how do they know there be azerbaijanis there if they just pick place think that armenians live there we have list of the resident for our part of the building our name be in there but how could they know that azerbaijanis live on the other side of the wall from we so they do not set fire to our apartment do not know be in such bad shape that if all of it have come to halt when be outside if someone have ask what be happen would have say that civil war be go on well maybe not civil but probably civil because when they be beat open my eye and see that all the neighbor be stand on their balcony and watch like at free horror film so civil war be go on and only the armenians be be fight if it be world war or something like that they would have be fight everyone but they only fight we then meet some woman from our building some azerbaijanis they be cry they tell karina we see all of it how could it happen they be ask well just do not know what to call it if normal girl can stand there and watch what happen to think that if it be the other way around either would not have be able to take it or would have try to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman do in front of our building woman live there an awful dissipate woman if you can call she woman the dissipate life she lead two armenian family live there in her part of the building she come out on the balcony and see what be happen to and start to scream and curse she come down to the entryway and say you will come in this entryway over my dead body so not one of they take it in his head to go in that entryway some folk be say that those people be so out of control that they do not even know what they be do do not think that be true they know very well what they be do if they do not even lift hand against that woman they could not have care less about she but the fact that she be an azerbaijani stop they they be just beast they have smoke so much when they come to our place they be all chew something notice everyone who come into the apartment be chew something think my god maybe just think that maybe be lose my mind but no they be all chew something maybe it be some kind of drug it must be because at first glance they all seem come to some sort of celebration but they be shout something they do not talk they shout as though there be deaf people there they scream and scream yeah killing kill we be kill the armenians only they do not shout kill they shout gurun ermianlary gurun literally mean kill or destroy that be how it be will continue we hide in captain apartment he be an azerbaijani his wife be tatar we be sit in their apartment their kid be out in the yard their kid know whole lot this be in our part of the building on the third floor when mamma come to and could not findyuda she take papa hand this be while the looter be steal thing but they do

paper in little black bag we keep everything in there mamma do not really like to wear gold she probably never even wear those thing from the time they be buy for she they take everything that be lie on the cheval glass mamma think that the gold save we because they throw themselves at the gold and mamma grab papa who be try to breathe they have close his mouth bind his hand and put pillow and chair on his face they have shove something into his mouth so he would suffocate mamma grab he and tear all that stuff off he have something in his mouth he be have trouble breathing his nose be fill with blood mamma grab he and start run from the fifth down to the first floor because no one want accident that person open his door he be sleep and say half awake what be happen he see that they be bloody mamma say at least go and find out what be happen to my daughter even if they have burn they or murder they at least bring the corpse he went look for we at that momentyuda be under the bed she say that after they leave it seem that someone be call her name when he quietly call she she could not get out she be shout but in fact she be either silent or be only talk to herself it just seem to she that she be shout when she get out from under the bed everyone be go and again she think that she have lose her mind will never leave here never to hell with it it just seem that way to will come to eventually but then when everything have settle down stop that mall bringyuda down and igor carry in from outside or first be bring in thenyuda do not remember what order it happen in and mamma say

there introduction to the rec auto newsgroup hierarchy rec autos tech be intend for technical discussion of automobile their design construction diagnosis and service other discussion be largely inappropriate especially for sale ad rec autos sport be intend for discussion of legal organized competition involve automobile technical discussion be appropriate insofar as they apply spectator and participant be encourage argument about sport car be largely inappropriate as be most other discussion for sale ad be inappropriate unless they be for competition vehicle and or equipment discussion of illegal event be marginal one should probably avoid advocate break the law remember the fbi read usenet rec autos drive be intend for discussion relate to the driving of automobile also if you must discuss vs or radar detector or insert your pet driving peeve bonehead do it here rec autosw be intend for discussion of issue relate to the use and ownership of automobile manufacture by volkswagen this includew audis seats etc it be create on the ground that the infow mailing list be very successful it should not be presume from the existence of this group that it be appropriate to create many group to cover many different marque group specific to individual marque should only be create on demonstration of sufficient interest via some avenue such as mailing list rec audio car be not properly part of the rec auto hierarchy it be however the correct place for discussion of automotive audio equipment and so be mention here rec autos antique be intend for the discussion of old car usually more than year old although this be not hard and fast rule alt hotrod be not part of the hierarchy but also of potential interest to the rec autos reader it be gatewaye to the moderated hotrod mailing list and be for serious discussion of modify and develop performance vehicle alt autos rod custom also not part of the official hierarchy devote to that peculiar american hobby of customize old car alt autos karting for the discussion of the popular motorsport and hobby karting rec autos be intend to capture discussion on all other automotive topic crossposte crossposte occur when more than one newsgroup name be include on the newsgroups line in the article header such article will appear in all of the newsgroup list crossposte be one of the most misunderstood and misuse facility on usenet you should only post to group because you feel an article be appropriate you should never crosspost just to reach particular audience this distinction be subtle but important radar detector article for example be more or less appropriate in rec auto they be almost never appropriate in sci electronic or rec ham radio and the fact that you might want to reach the audience in sci electronic or rec ham radio be not adequate justification for post to either group crossposte between any or all of the rec auto group be usually inappropriate if you find yourself do so consider whether or not it be truly advisable before send your article consider set followup to crossposte between rec auto and misc consumer be chancy at good in particular flame war over the speed limit in the us and or the use of radar detector should never be crossposte between any of these group most reader of sci electronic and rec radio could not care less about the police radar and radar detector argument that go on endlessly in rec auto it be an excellent idea to check the newsgroups and followup to line of article before post followup in particular be wary of post to misc test rec arts startrek or talk bizarre or any combination of these three the life you save may be your own there be field in the header of any news article which allow you to partially control where the article go it be call the distribution field it may be very useful for many reason it should also serve as reminder that news be very large and widespread system the distribution of rec auto be fairly extensive as of this writing the automotive newsgroup be know to reach most of europe australia new zealand and some location in japan with this in mind offer the follow hint about use of the distribution field in your article header and on article content please take care not to send for sale ad about clap out ford mavericks in new jersey to france or california doubt that anyone in either place will care except for my girlfriend who for some strange reason like mavericks but only door mavericks at that when post technical question please include the market for which your car be manufacture for example there be number of difference between european market ford escort and us market escort likewise all and early alfa romeos reach the us with spica fuel injection european market car usually get carb often webers these difference can be important to your reader make your situation clear failure to do so can lead to pointless flame war and significant spread of misinformation be careful about your capacity and specification when post in the us we get mix of metric and english system value whereas europe be almost entirely on the metric system future edition of this monthly posting will contain list of commonly use abbreviation that may not be know in some place that rec auto reach this cut both way so let we not be parochial about it use the distribution field to limit where your article go when possible within north america the value na north america can canada and usa may be use in addition the two letter state abbreviation of the us be support in some case if want ny nj in distribution field note that multiple comma separate value be legal these distribution field vary widely however so you should check with your local sysadmin to find out what be likely the dangers of overgeneralization be wary of make foolish assumption about all car tire etc what be true for buick with engine may be quite utterly wrong for honda with engine headlight law in sweden be decidedly different from those in idaho the need for adequate specification when you ask question please give reasonable amount of information if you have question about your honda please specify year model engine size etc otherwise most answer to your question may be quite useless concern lemon at one time or another every auto manufacturer have manufacture lemon or two even honda admit to this please do not waste everyone time by announce to the world that your brand automobile be terrible so all brand automobile be terrible so no one should ever buy car from the brand company such article be bad than useless because they cause substantial waste bandwidth while carry little or no useful information concern flame as much as we might wish it flame free newsgroup be something that most likely will never occur here be some guideline for flame and how of this posting if you post something truly obnoxious and inflammatory do not imagine for minute that include the word no flames will work it will not and you will get exactly what you deserve if you be go to flame you be more likely to get away with it if you can cite fact or maybe well know reference no one be likely to believe bald unsupported assertion be careful about who you choose to insult consider not insult anyone ask the question it be bad idea to post question and end it with phrase like please send email do not read this group it be much well idea to end the question with please send email if there be sufficient interest will summarize the result in later posting may miss post response answer the question if someone want to hop up their yugo do not tell they to get mustang either be silent or give they useful advice if someone want advice on defend speed ticket do not tell they to obey the law next time it be offensive presume guilt which be not prove and do not directly address the original question in general do not post in order to see your word in print and do not post in order to enjoy feel smug and self righteous stale and or inflammatory topic certain topic be consider stale by old timer while discussion of they be certainly ok and new factual information be welcome raving about they be extremely tiresome and may get the person who post they ignore altogether some topic be naturally inflammatory it be difficult if not impossible to have meaningful discussion of they some of these topic include the following the mph speed limit in the us pro and con discussion about the morality and legality of the sale and usage of radar detector discussion over which radar detector be good

introduction to atheism by mathew this article attempt to provide general introduction to atheism whilst have try to be as neutral as possible regard contentious issue you should always remember that this document represent only one viewpoint would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusion some relevant book be list in companion article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and theist all the question ask by the imaginary theist be question which have be crop up repeatedly on alt atheism since the newsgroup be create some other frequently ask question be answer in companion article please note that this article be arguably slant towards answer question pose from christian viewpoint this be because the faq file reflect question which have actually be ask and it be predominantly christians who proselytize on alt atheism so when talk of religion be talk primarily about religion such as christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine be much of the discussion will apply to other religion but some of it may not what be atheism atheism be characterize by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheist go far and believe that god do not exist the former be often refer to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism it be important to note the difference between these two position weak atheism be simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strong atheism be positive belief that god do not exist please do not fall into the trap of assume that all atheist be strong atheist some atheist believe in the non existence of all god other limit their atheism to specific god such as the christian god rather than make flat out denial but be not disbelieve in god the same thing as believe he do not exist definitely not disbelief in proposition mean that one do not believe it to be true not believe that something be true be not equivalent to believe that it be false one may simply have no idea whether it be true or not which bring we to agnosticism what be agnosticism then the term agnosticism be coin by professor huxley at meeting of the metaphysical society in he define an agnostic as someone who disclaim strong atheism and believe that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and unknowable thus an agnostic be someone who believe that we do not and can not know for sure whether god exist word be slippery thing and language be inexact beware of assume that you can work out someone philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she call herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when refer to strong atheism beware also that because the word atheist have so many shade of meaning it be very difficult to generalize about atheist about all you can say for sure be that atheist do not believe in god for example it certainly be not the case that all atheist believe that science be the good way to find out about the universe so what be the philosophical justification or basis for atheism there be many philosophical justification for atheism to find out why particular person choose to be an atheist it be good to ask she many atheist feel that the idea of god as present by the major religion be essentially self contradictory and that it be logically impossible that such god could exist other be atheist through scepticism because they see no evidence that god exist but be not it impossible to prove the non existence of something there be many counter example to such statement for example it be quite simple to prove that there do not exist prime number large than all other prime number of course this deal with well define object obey well define rule whether god or universe be similarly well define be matter for debate however assume for the moment that the existence of god be not provably impossible there be still subtle reason for assume the non existence of god if we assume that something do not exist it be always possible to show that this assumption be invalid by find single counter example if on the other hand we assume that something do exist and if the thing in question be not provably impossible show that the assumption be invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such thing might be find to show that it be not there such an exhaustive search be often impractical or impossible there be no such problem with large prime because we can prove that they do not exist therefore it be generally accept that we must assume thing do not exist unless we have evidence that they do even theist follow this rule most of the time they do not believe in unicorn even though they can not conclusively prove that no unicorn exist anywhere test we can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he do not exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assume by default that god do not exist since that be an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exist instead they generally restrict their claim so as to cover variety of god describe by follower of various religion so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exist it may be possible to prove that say god as describe by particular religious book do not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god describe by any present day religion exist in practice believe that no god describe by any religion exist be very close to believe that no god exist however it be sufficiently different that counter argument base on the impossibility of disprove every kind of god be not really applicable but what if god be essentially non detectable if god interact with our universe in any way the effect of his interaction must be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable if god be essentially non detectable it must therefore be the case that he do not interact with our universe in any way many atheist would argue that if god do not interact with our universe at all it be of no importance whether he exist or not if the bible be to be believe god be easily detectable by the israelites surely he should still be detectable today verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some effect cause by his presence though otherwise how can distinguish he ok you may think there be philosophical justification for atheism but be not it still religious belief one of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion be the redefinition game the cynical view of this game be as follow person begin by make contentious statement when person point out that it can not be true person gradually re define the word he use in the statement until he arrive at something person be prepared to accept he then record the statement along with the fact that person have agree to it and continue eventually use the statement as an agree fact but use his original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure redefinition originally need to get to agree to it rather than be see the point of this digression be that the answer to the question be not atheism religious belief depend crucially upon what be mean by religious religion be generally characterize by belief in superhuman control power especially in some sort of god and by faith and worship it be worth point out in pass that some variety of buddhism be not religion accord to such definition atheism be certainly not belief in any sort of superhuman power nor be it categorize by worship in any meaningful sense widen the definition of religious to encompass atheism tend to result in many other aspect of human behaviour suddenly becoming class as religious as well such as science politic and watch tv ok so it be not religion but surely belief in atheism or science be still just an act of faith like religion be firstly it be not entirely clear that sceptical atheism be something one actually believe in secondly it be necessary to adopt number of core belief or assumption to make some sort of sense out of the sensory datum we experience most atheist try to adopt as few core belief as possible and even those be subject to question if experience throw they into doubt science have number of core assumption for example it be generally assume that the law of physics be the same for all observer these be the sort of core assumption atheist make if such basic idea be call act of faith then almost everything we know must be say to be base on act of faith and the term lose its meaning faith be more often use to refer to complete certain belief in something accord to such definition atheism and science be certainly not act of faith of course individual atheist or scientist can be as dogmatic as religious follower when claim that something be certain this be not general tendency however there be many atheist who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exist faith be also use to refer to belief without support evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly do not fit that definition as sceptical atheism have no belief strong atheism be close but still do not really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental datum or the lack of it when assert that god do not exist if atheism be not religious surely it be anti religious it be an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy the truth be not so clear cut atheism be the position that run logically counter to theism in that sense it can be say to be anti religion however when religious believer speak of atheist be anti religious they usually mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theist this categorization of atheist as hostile towards religion be quite unfair atheist attitude towards theist in fact cover broad spectrum most atheist take live and let live attitude unless question they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friend of course this may be in part because atheism be not socially acceptable in many country few atheist be quite anti religious and may even try to convert other when possible historically such anti religious atheist have make little impact on society outside the eastern bloc country to digress slightly the soviet union be originally dedicate to separation of church and state just like the usa soviet citizen be legally free to worship as they wish the institution of state atheism come about when stalin take control of the soviet union and try to destroy the church in order to gain complete power over the population some atheist be quite vocal about their belief but only where they see religion encroach on matter which be not its business for example the government of the usa such individual be usually concerned that church and state should remain separate but if you do not allow religion to have say in the running of the state surely that be the same as state atheism the principle of the separation of church and state be that the state shall not legislate concern matter of religious belief in particular it mean not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it can not promote any belief which be religious in nature religion can still have say in discussion of purely secular matter for example religious believer have historically be responsible for encourage many political reform even today many organization campaign for an increase in spending on foreign aid be found as religious campaign so long as they campaign concern secular matter and so long as they do not discriminate on religious ground most atheist be quite happy to see they have their say what about prayer in school if there be no god why do you care if people pray because people who do pray be voter and lawmaker and tend to do thing that those who do not pray can not just ignore also christian prayer in school be intimidate to non christians even if they be tell that they need not join in the diversity of religious and non religious belief mean that it be impossible to formulate meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event also non prayer tend to have friend and family who pray it be reasonable motive you mention christians who campaign for increase foreign aid what about atheist why be not there any atheist charity or hospital do not atheist object to the religious charity there be many charity without religious purpose that atheist can contribute to some atheist contribute to religious charity as well for the sake of the practical good they do some atheist even do voluntary work for charity found on theistic basis most atheist seem to feel that atheism be not worth shout about in connection with charity to they atheism be just simple obvious everyday matter and so be charity many feel that it be somewhat cheap not to say self righteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug particular set of religious belief rather strange idea it be rather like hold party to say today be not my birthday why the fuss atheism be rarely evangelical you say atheism be not anti religious but be it perhaps backlash against one upbringing way of rebel perhaps it be for some but many people have parent who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist idea upon they and many of those people choose to call themselves atheist it be also doubtless the case that some religious people choose religion as backlash against an atheist upbringing as way of be different on the other hand many people choose religion as way of conform to the expectation of other on the whole we can not conclude much about whether atheism or religion be backlash or conformism although in general people have tendency to go along with group rather than act or think independently how do atheist differ from religious people they do not believe in god that be all there be to it atheist may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer verdi requiem even if they know the word they may wear hawaiian shirt they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robe many buddhist lack belief in any sort of god some atheist even carry copy of the bible around for argue against of course whoever you be the chance be you have meet several atheist without realise it atheist be usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance unexceptional but be not atheist less moral than religious people that depend if you define morality as obedience to god then of course atheist be less moral as they do not obey any god but usually when one talk of morality one talk of what be acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society human be social animal and to be maximally successful they must co operate with each other this be good enough reason to discourage most atheist from anti social or immoral behaviour purely for the purpose of self preservation many atheist behave in moral or compassionate way simply because they feel natural tendency to empathize with other human so why do they care what happen to other they do not know they simply be that way naturally there be some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their action however there be equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious belief to justify their action for example here be trustworthy saying that deserve full acceptance jesus christ come into the world to save sinner but for that very reason be show mercy so that in jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in he and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever the above quote be from statement make to the court on february by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin it seem that for every atheist mass murderer there be religious mass murderer but what of more trivial morality survey conduct by the roper organization find that behavior deteriorate after bear again experience while only of respondent say they have drive intoxicate before be bear again have do so after conversion similarly have use illegal drug before conversion after two percent admit to engage in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september so it seem that at good religion do not have monopoly on moral behaviour be there such thing as atheist morality if you mean be there such thing as morality for atheist then the answer be yes as explain above many atheist have idea about morality which be at least as strong as those hold by religious people if you mean do atheism have characteristic moral code then the answer be no atheism by itself do not imply anything much about how person will behave most atheist follow many of the same moral rule as theist but for different reason atheist view morality as something create by human accord to the way human feel the world ought to work rather than see it as set of rule decree by supernatural being then be not atheist just theist who be deny god study by the freedom from religion foundation find that over of the atheist who respond become atheist because religion do not work for they they have find that religious belief be fundamentally incompatible with what they observe around they atheist be not unbeliever through ignorance or denial they be unbeliever through choice the vast majority of they have spend time study one or more religion sometimes in very great depth they have make careful and consider decision to reject religious belief this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual personality for naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism be often the only one that make sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make but do not atheist want to believe in god atheist live their life as though there be nobody watch over they many of they have no desire to be watch over no matter how good natured the big brother figure might be some atheist would like to be able to believe in god but so what should one believe thing merely because one want they to be true the risk of such an approach should be obvious atheist often decide that want to believe something be not enough there must be evidence for the belief but of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of god they be unwilling in their soul to see many if not most atheist be previously religious as have be explain above the vast majority have seriously consider the possibility that god exist many atheist have spend time in prayer try to reach god of course it be true that some atheist lack an open mind but assume that all atheist be biased and insincere be offensive and closed minded comment such as of course god be there you just be not look properly be likely to be view as patronize certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it be vital that you give they the benefit of the doubt and assume that they be be sincere if they say that they have search for god if you be not willing to believe that they be basically tell the truth debate be futile be not the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist many atheist live purposeful life they decide what they think give meaning to life and they pursue those goal they try to make their life count not by wish for eternal life but by have an influence on other people who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leave his mark on history it be natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random event however it be by no mean obvious that life be the sort of thing that have meaning sensible thing to ask some atheist believe that ask what be the meaning of life be as silly as ask what be the meaning of cup of coffee they believe that life have no purpose or meaning it just be so how do atheist find comfort in time of danger there be many way of obtain comfort from family friend or even pet or on less spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what should individual believe in thing because they be comfort or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end it be decision for the individual concern most atheist be unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it make they feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider that if search for truth sometimes make they feel unhappy that be just hard luck do not atheist worry that they might suddenly be show to be wrong the short answer be no do you many atheist have be atheist for year they have encounter many argument and much suppose evidence for the existence of god but they have find all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousand of year of religious belief have not result in any good proof of the existence of god atheist therefore tend to feel that they be unlikely so why should theist question their belief do not the same argument apply no because the belief be question be not similar weak atheism be the sceptical default position to take it assert nothing strong atheism be negative belief theism be very strong positive belief atheist sometimes also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believer but to everyone else what sort of harm religion represent huge financial and work burden on mankind it be not just matter of religious believer waste their money on church building think of all the time and effort spend build church pray and so on imagine how that effort could be well spend many theist believe in miracle healing there have be plenty of instance of ill people be heal by priest cease to take the medicine prescribe to they by doctor and die as result some theist have die because they have refuse blood transfusion on religious ground it be arguable that the catholic church opposition to birth control and condom in particular be increase the problem of overpopulation in many third world country and contribute to the spread of aids world wide religious believer have be know to murder their child rather than allow their child to become atheist or marry someone of different religion those be not real believer they just claim to be believer as some sort of excuse what make real believer there be so many one true religions it be hard convinced that they be the only true christians sometimes they even fight and kill each other how be an atheist suppose to decide who be real christian and who be not when even the major christian church like the catholic church and the church of england can not decide amongst themselves in the end most atheist take pragmatic view and decide that anyone who call himself christian and use christian belief or dogma to justify his action should be consider christian maybe some of those christians be just pervert christian teaching for their own end but surely if the bible can be so readily use to support un christian act it can not be much of moral code if the bible be the word of god why could not he have make it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your belief be not perversion of what your god intend if there be no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so sorry but if someone claim that he believe in jesus and that he murder other because jesus and the bible tell he to do so we must call he christian obviously those extreme sort of belief should be question but since nobody have ever prove that god do not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious belief share by all faith be nonsense that do not hold because as be point out at the start of this dialogue positive assertion concern the existence of entity be inherently much hard to disprove than negative one nobody have ever prove that unicorn do not exist but that do not make it unlikely that they be myth it be therefore much more valid to hold negative assertion by default than it be to hold positive assertion by default of course weak atheist would argue that assert nothing be well still well if atheism be so great why be there so many theist unfortunately the popularity of belief have little to do with how correct it be or whether it work consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo science many atheist feel that it be simply human weakness to want to believe in god certainly in many primitive human society religion allow the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand of course there be more to religion than that in the industrialized world we find people believe in religious explanation of phenomenon even when there be perfectly adequate natural explanation religion may have start as means of attempt to explain the world but nowadays it serve other purpose as well but so many culture have develop religion surely that must say something not really most religion be only superficially similar for example it be worth remember that religion such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense of course most religion be quick to denounce compete religion so it be rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another what about all the famous scientist and philosopher who have conclude that god exist for every scientist or philosopher who believe in god there be one who do not besides as have already be point out the truth of belief be not determine by how many people believe it also it be important to realize that atheist do not view famous scientist or philosopher in the same way that theist view their religious leader famous scientist be only human she may be an expert in some field but when she talk about other matter her word carry no special weight many respected scientist have make themselves look foolish by speak on subject which lie outside their field of expertise so be you really say that widespread belief in religion indicate nothing not entirely it certainly indicate that the religion in question have property which have help it so spread so far the theory of memetic talk of meme set of idea which can propagate themselves between human mind by analogy with gene some atheist view religion as set of particularly successful parasitic meme which spread by encourage their host to convert other some meme avoid destruction by discourage believer from question doctrine or by use peer pressure religious meme even encourage their host to destroy host control by other meme of course in the memetic view there be no particular virtue associate with successful propagation of meme religion be not good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than disease be good thing because of the number of people who have catch it even if religion be not entirely true at least it put across important message what be the fundamental message of atheism there be many important idea atheist promote the follow be just few of they do not be surprised to see idea which be also present in some religion there be more to moral behaviour than mindlessly follow rule be especially sceptical of positive claim if you want your life to have some sort of meaning it be up to you to find it search for what be true even if it make you uncomfortable make the most of your life as it be probably the only one you will have it be no good rely on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because something be popular do not mean it be good if you must assume something assume something it be easy to test do not believe thing just because you want they to be true and finally and most importantly all belief should be open to

question mr stephanopoulos well as you know the discussion be go on this morning in the senate betwen senator mitchell and senator dole let us see what they come up with but the president believe his job program should go forward george would the president be willing to accept billion for one year which apparently appear to be the compromise be offer by mr stephanopoulos well do not know what be be offer by either side the senate discussion be go on right now let us see what happen today would he go that far no matter what the republicans have offer so far would he go that far billion per year mr stephanopoulos the president believe that his program should be pass at this time clearly we be go to be willing to listen to what the senators might or might not be able to come up with but

president job bill than in do something to create real action real job this summer for the american people think there be no question about that there be be some frustration of legislative activity over the last few day so you will need to compromise to get your package through mr stephanopoulos we will see what happen with the conversation between senator mitchell and senator dole this morning prepare to compromise mr stephanopoulos the president prepared to listen with senator dole do he feel that he have be defeat in his mr stephanopoulos not in the least in fact he be be very successful so far in the beginning of his term how mr stephanopoulos he pass his budget in record time in six week and it be budget which reduce the deficit by billion over five year and it be budget which provide for important investment in our future right now we have also have strong passage of his job program through the house simply because minority of republicans in the senate choose to perpetuate gridlock and hold up action on the president job program be not sign that he be not succeed overall he can not beat this can he the fact be they can do that mr stephanopoulos well the republicans can stop action there be no question about that what be you go to do about it george what do you know about these allege note take by boris yeltsin during one of the meeting in which it appear that the president tell boris yeltsin not to trust the japanese that when they say yes they mean no mr stephanopoulos think that be complete misreading of what happen at the meeting the context of the conversation be that president clinton be actually reassure president yeltsin at the time about his conversation with prime minister miyazawa over the kuril islands and the prime minister belief that japan would play constructive role in the process mean this be casual comment about japanese courtesy and etiquette but overall it be in the context of conversation where he be reassure president yeltsin that he believe the japanese be serious about their commitment to the process be you say that the president say that when the japanese say yes they mean no mr stephanopoulos that be not do not know the exact word and there be much long discussion about he do say something along the line that he believe that on this issue prime minister miyazawa intend to really go forward with the process have there be any attempt to explain this to the japanese because apparently the japanese press have pick this up and there appear to be mr stephanopoulos have see the report in the japanese press and it actually do put the situation in context it do talk about the japanese understand the japanese point of view do not think it be go to be problem believe that there may have be some diplomatic context just to clear thing up but be not positive george be the specific comment that be make specific to the kuril island situation or be it general observation on japanese etiquette mr stephanopoulos the discussion be about the specific comment be what be ask about that have allege to have be translate from the russian note when the japanese say yes they mean no mr stephanopoulos well it be combination mean do not think that be the whole sentence think that the specific comment be broad general observation follow up by specific finish to the sentence where he say in this case he believe that prime minister miyazawa mean to keep the commitment be he say it facetiously first mr stephanopoulos think it be just casual observation and then you say diplomatic contact be make to clear it up have the president send message mr stephanopoulos no do not think the president speak believe that secretary christopher have make some call but be not sure exactly how many well this obviously be big deal than you be make it out to be if christopher have have to make some call mr stephanopoulos no no it be just that we get the report in vancouver and the secretary want to make sure that it be understand and make sure there be absolutely no mr stephanopoulos report in vancouver and the secretary want to make sure that it be understand and make sure there be absolutely no misunderstanding and do not believe there be on what be our position about the japanese that they may have to say one thing but actualy mean another mr stephanopoulos no the position on the japanese be as the president state to president yeltsin throughout the two day he say that he have have good conversation with prime minister miazawa prior to the summit he reiterate the position the long stand support for the japanese position on the kuril islands but also reiterate prime minister miazawa commitment to move forward on the process and to play constructive role and think president yeltsin be very glad to hear that after listen to secretary christopher on iraq for the last few day be little confused what be the policy do you want to see saddam hussein overturn mr stephanopoulos it be the same policy that secretary christopher have reiterate and all of the official have reiterate we expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance with all resolution right now we do not have that compliance throw it out far that if iraq comply saddam can not stay in office mr stephanopoulos right think that that be our judgment be that it be not possible for saddam hussein to comply with the resolution and stay in power but the important point be that we expect compliance by iraq with all resolution and we will continue to demand it and be you concerned the iran will become the dominant power in the area mr stephanopoulos secretary christopher have also speak to iran over the last several day and he say we also expect full iranian compliance with all international norm and stop support of terrorism that be verylib statement that he will not stay in power if he comply with resolution on what logic do you base that mr stephanopoulos right now saddam hussein be not comply with the resolution at all he be not respect the right of his people as be require by the resolution he be not fully comply with all the resolution regard inspection he be not fully comply with all the resolution regard armament well when do you think that if he do comply he would be out of power mr stephanopoulos well right now his power rest on the repression of his people if he stop do that it would make it more difficult for he to stay in power george back on the stimulus package why be it that you and the president accuse the republicans of play pure politic and perpetuate gridlock why be it that what evidence do you have that they just do not have genuine idealogical difference with you that be in good faith mr stephanopoulos well the fact that several time in the past the republicans many of the one who be now lead the fight for the filibuster have support the very funding they now seek to stop most especially the highway funding george in regard to that some of the moderate republicans say that the white house err by not be more open to they during the while the plan be put together that they have one sort of proforma meeting between the white house and the senate republicans and that be it do the administration look back and think perhaps it could have do well job of work with some mr stephanopoulos well be not sure that it be true that there be only one meeting mean the president meet with the republican leadership on at least two occasion before the introduction of his package he meet with the entire senate republican caucus also for lunch and go up there we be continually in contact with as many republicans as we can find who have an interest in the president package we be interested in what they have to say as well but we believe that this program be important and we be go to continue to fight for it your all or nothing do it with the democrats alone strategy do you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it through mr stephanopoulos well mean think that there be no question that under the senate rule determined minority can frustrate activity mean there be just no question about that you only need plus one to keep go plus one to keep go and to stop any action and that be what the republicans be do go to rethink the way you attempt to get other thing pass as you go through this process for the rest of the summer work with republicans and try to woo some republicans into your camp mr stephanopoulos think we be go to continue to look for the support of republicans whenever we can get it on the president intiative but on this one how be you go to do it differently than you do it on this one because on this one you really do stiff the republicans from the beginning and make it clear that it be democratic majority that would get this through and could get it through and you really do not need republican vote be you go to take different tack when you have to go for particular vote when you have to go through mr stephanopoulos can not see into the future and understand every possible turn in the legislative road clearly the president go to continue to reach out when he can you do not have any regret then about the way you have handle it up to now and you do not plan any change in your approach in deal with the republicans in congress base on this experience mr stephanopoulos obviously the president would like his package pass as quickly as possible and he be go to continue there be not question about that and we will continue to reason with they and try and find appropriate avenue for cooperation in this case the republicans have choose to unify around filibuster around plan to frustrate action not plan to move forward they be be deny any other legislative mean of put their proposal forward mr stephanopoulos think they be be any idea mr stephanopoulos think their amendment be be defeat do not know that they be be deny to present they mr stephanopoulos that be not exactly true mean they get the vote that theirs can be pass though by the parliamentary rule under which they be play mr stephanopoulos unless they get majority in support all the way around no that be not exactly true george one more on iraq be the administration back any of the iraqi opposition groom any new leadership back any of the iraqi leadership mr stephanopoulos oh again we be press for iraqi compliance do not know if we can get into the business of groom leadership believe there have be some contact at some level with iraqi opposition group do not know about anything recently jesse jackson who of course be not the president good friend have however be tell that there be to be some kind of town meeting or some kind of involvement by the president pre empte the ball game los angeles will he consider something like that or any other kind of intervention there mr stephanopoulos well as you know the president appoint commerce secretary ron brown about day ago to be special envoy to california and coordiante cabinet activity around the california economic situation include the situation in los angeles believe there will also be visit out to los angeles by the education or have be visit by the education secretary mr riley believe that transportation secretary pena and hud secretary cisneros be also go out and there may be other visit by cabinet official over the next several day and week would not rule out the possibility of visit by president clinton to california obviously he be follow the situation closely and be concerned about make sure that we make the right long term policy decision that will help create the kind of economic opportunity which help prevent disturbance but we be go to continue to watch it george as follow up reverend jackson be also suppose to be outside the ball park today in baltimore with group of supporter protest the lack of minority in baseball management do the president have position on that mr stephanopoulos the president have receive correspondence from reverend jackson know that reverend jackson have also speak with the white house chief of staff mack mclarty he clearly raise serious question there have be some progress in baseball over the last several year but still not enough but the president intend to continue to go to the ball game be he go to say anything about it today or see reverend jackson while he be out there mr stephanopoulos do not know if he be go to see they but as say the president believe that reverend jackson have raise some serious question and it be something that as say even though there have be progress it be clearly not enough do reverend jackson ask he not to go to the ball game mr stephanopoulos be not sure about that believe the characterization the reverend jackson be talk about be an informational pickett do not know that he ask he not to go to the ball game but he send long detailed formal letter outline his concern with the situation in major league baseball and the president read it george the orioles be play the rangers the manage partner of the rangers be george bush be he go to be there and be he go to meet with the president mr stephanopoulos do not know what be the mubarak schedule mr stephanopoulos know that president mubarak be come tomorrow morning for working meeting they will have lunch and believe that he be have dinner tonight with vice president gore and joint statement tomorrow mr stephanopoulos believe so yes at the end yes be there evidence george that the egyptians do warn the about potential terrorist bombing terrorist activity mr stephanopoulos as report in the new york times mean think that president mubarak do say that there have be general conversation with the egyptians as there have be for long period of time we do have general intelligence sharing mean but president mubarak be very careful to point out that there be no specific information on this visit that be pass forward the president will continue to investigate the situation but he also reiterate his belief that we can not tolerate terrorism of any kind george he do make specific or the egyptians apparently do issue specific warning about this individual who forgive this individual who forgive the name escape at the moment and say the egyptians be more or less rebuffed in their attempt to get some kind of action mr stephanopoulos again do not know if would agree with your characterization of the mubarak interview he do say that they give general warning about the possibility of network in the united states and upon which we take appropriate action but there be no specific information on this specific operation at all so the white house do not feel that any of the law enforcement agency whether it be the cia or fbi who would have receive this kind of information be lax or derelict in its duty in not pursue some kind of mr stephanopoulos no not at all what be next with serbia it get only pass mention in the news conference yesterday mr stephanopoulos you do not get to ask your question yes exactly be there any agreement on concerted action between the two country and even if there be not what do the do next mr stephanopoulos think the be clearly go ally on sanction resolution and we will continue to look for way agreement george why do you think sanction be still an option mean the serbians make it clear that at least the leadership be survive just fine and they feel like they can wait you out and even the administration official we have in the other day say there be no evidence that they be go to have an effect any time soon the bosnian serbs have say no to the peace plan when do no mean no and you have to do something different mr stephanopoulos well mean we be do something different we be move forward on further sanction through the and those discussion will continue we be go to continue to try and tighten the noose on serbia and think that every opportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time be we look again at lift the arm embargo mr stephanopoulos the president have say that this be something that be under consideration george do you have any more on hugh rodham condition how he be do mr stephanopoulos as far as know nothing be change george week after mr mubarak mr stephanopoulos it be little unclear think we will be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning after the mubarak visit be he go somewhere for easter mr stephanopoulos not that know of what more can you tell we about the additional aid mr stephanopoulos he be go to be consult with the congress and with our partner over the next couple of week know that he speak last evening with congressman gephardt and their delegation before the the congressional delegation meet with the russians this week and those consultation will continue over the next several week do you expect that package to be of the magnitude of the one announce sunday mr stephanopoulos be not go to discuss the magnitude how about the list of cold war restriction where do you stand on that mr stephanopoulos as the president say yesterday he be go to be look for that list from the congress this week and review it he believe he be go to try and get it this week and he be go to review the list and we be go to take hard look at it but they be make it up mean it be no white house involvement congress be compile this list mr stephanopoulos think he be go to talk to the congressional leader about compile the list but be certain we will be able to get our own researcher work as well george be not lift the arm embargo more of probability than possibility mr stephanopoulos it be something that be under discussion secretary christopher have say that it be matter of time and for month before that happen mr stephanopoulos again all can say be that it be something that the president be review right now we be work with our ally in the on sanction resolution and we will continue to review other matter george can you tell we anything about the schedule this week any travel mr stephanopoulos they just ask about that do not have anything more beyond tomorrow visit with mubarak right now be

poland where its three and half million jews live in ghetto and be visibly different from the rest of the polish population the hungarian jews be an integrate part of the community the middle class be mainly jewish the jews be mainly middle class they enjoy freedom of travel serve in the hungarian fascist army in fronline unit as officer and soldier their name be hungarian how beichmann to find they if they be to be exterminate the task be not easy there be million jews in hungary most of they resident the rest be refugee from other country many have hear about the fate of jews elsewhere and be unlikely to believe any statement by nazi official like elsewhere the only people who have the information and the ear of the frightened jewish population be the judenrat in this case the judenrat comprsie mainly the zionist federation member without their help the ss with officer and less than man plus few hundred hungarian police could not have collect and control million jews when they do not even know their whereabout kastner and the other be leave under no illusionichmann tell joel brand one of the member of kastner committee that he intend to send all hungary jews to auschwitz before he even start the expulsion he tell they clearly that all these jews will die day unless certain condition be meet the committee face simple choice to tell the jews of hungary about their fate with neutral rumania where many could escape be in most case few hour away or to collaborate with the nazis by assist in the concentration process what would not have be believe when come from the ss sound quite plausible when come from the mouth of the zionist leadership thus it be that most of the hungarian jews go quietly to their death assure by their leadership that they be to be send to work camp destruction the train of prominent whichichmann promise to kastner promise he keep to the last detail forichmann it be bargain allow jews to survive as the price pay for the silent collaboration over the death of almost million jews there be no way in which the jews of hungary could even be locate not to say murder without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friend no doubt the ss would hunt few jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have be miniscule compare to the half million who die in auschwitz it be important to realise that kastner be not an aberration like say rumkovsky in lodz kastner act as result of his strongly hold zionist conviction his action be logical outcome of early position this be instance when he expose to the gestapo the existence of british cell of saboteur palgi and senesh and persuade they to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operation at no point during his trial or elsewhere do kastner deny that he know exactly what be to happen to those jews connect to another role they could and should have play that of alarm the whole world to what be happen in europe they have the information but politically it be contrary to their priority the priority be and still be quite simple all that further the zionist enterprise in palestine be follow whatever the price the life of individual jews and non jews be secondary if this process require deal with fascist nazis and other assorted dictatorial regime across the world so be it	['talk.politics.mideast']

original posting by larrylaes mostly minor format change matthew wiener contribute the section on voyager and the section on sakigake be obtain from isas material post by yoshiro yamada us planetary missions mariner venus mars mercury flybys and orbiter mariner the first attempt to send spacecraft to venus fail minute after launch in the guidance instruction from the ground stop reach the rocket due to problem with its antenna so the onboard computer take control however there turn out to be bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly go off course so the range safety officer destroy it although the bug be sometimes claim transcription error in which the bar indicate smoothing be omit of radius this error lead the software to treat normal minor variation of velocity as if they be serious lead to incorrect compensation mariner become the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of and it return information which confirm that venus be very hot degree fahrenheit now revise to degree world with cloud cover atmosphere compose primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid be later confirm in mariner launch on november be lose when its protective shroud fail toject as the craft be place into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun energy for power from its solar panel the probe soon die when its battery run out and be now in solar orbit it be intend for mars flyby with mariner mariner the sister probe to mariner do reach mars in and take the first close up image of the martian surface in all as it fly by the planet the probe find cratere world with an atmosphere much thin than previously think many scientist conclude from this preliminary scan that mars be dead world in both the geological and biological sense mariner be send to venus in it reconfirm the datum on that planet collect five year early by mariner plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface be at least time that of earth or the equivalent of be foot under the surface of an ocean mariner and be send to mars in and expand upon the work do by mariner four year early however they fail to take away the concept of mars as dead planet first make from the basic measurement of mariner mariner end up in the atlantic ocean in when the rocket launcher autopilot fail mariner the sister probe to mariner become the first craft to orbit mars in it return information on the red planet that no other probe have do before reveal huge volcano on the martian surface as well as giant canyon system and evidence that water once flow across the planet the probe also take the first detailed closeup image of mars two small moon phobos and deimos mariner use venus as gravity assist to mercury in the probe do return the first close up image of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet reveal previously unseen detail in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circle the planet in four earth day mariner eventually make three flyby of mercury from mercury as heavily cratere world with mass much great than thought this would seem to indicate that mercury have an iron core which make up percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiter pioneer through fail to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close up but they do reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon include new datum on the van allen radiation belt circle earth all three craft have failure with their rocket launcher pioneer be launch on october pioneer on november and pioneer on december pioneer be moon probe which miss the moon and become the first spacecraft to orbit the sun in pioneer be originally design to flyby venus but the mission be scale down and it instead study the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to million kilometer in record until mariner pioneer through be place into solar orbit from to pioneer and be still transmit information at this time pioneer would have be number suffer launch failure in pioneer become the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in pioneer follow it in and then go on to become the first probe to study saturn in both vehicle should continue to function through and be head off into interstellar space the first craft ever pioneer venus also know as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer burn up in the venusian atmosphere on october pvo make the first radar study of the planet surface via probe pioneer venus also know as pioneer send four small probe into the atmosphere in december of the main spacecraft bus burn up high in the atmosphere while the four probe descend by parachute towards the surface though none be expect to survive to the surface the day probe do make it and transmit for minute on the ground before its battery fail ranger lunar lander and impact mission ranger and be test probe for the ranger lunar impact series they be mean for high earth orbit testing in but rocket problem leave they in useless low orbit which quickly decay ranger launch on january be intend to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problem during the launch cause the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger do try to take some image of the moon as it fly by but the camera be unfortunately aim at deep space during the attempt ranger launch april have the same purpose as ranger but suffer technical problem enroute and crash on the lunar farside the first probe to reach the moon albeit without return datum ranger launch october and similar to ranger and lose all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually miss the moon and drift off into solar orbit ranger through have more modified lunar mission they be to send back live image of the lunar surface as they head towards an impact with the moon ranger fail this objective in when its camera do not operate ranger through perform well become the first lunar probe to return thousand of lunar image through lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter through be design to orbit the moon and image various site be study as landing area for the manned apollo mission of the probe also contribute greatly to our understanding of lunar surface feature particularly the lunar farside all five probe of the series launch from to be essentially successful in their mission they be the first probe to orbit the moon all lo be eventually crash into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo mission surveyor lunar soft lander the surveyor series be design primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sink into the soil before this time it be fear by some that the moon be cover in great layer of dust which would not support heavy landing vehicle surveyor be successful in prove that the lunar surface be strong enough to hold up spacecraft from to only surveyor and be unsuccessful mission the rest become the first probe to soft land on the moon take thousand of image and scoop the soil for analysis apollo land foot from surveyor in and return part of the craft to earth surveyor the last of the series be purely scientific mission which explore the tycho crater region in viking mars orbiter and lander viking be launch from cape canaveral florida on august on titan centaur rocket the probe go into martian orbit on june and the lander set down on the western slope of chryse planitia on july it soon begin its program search for martian micro organism there be still debate as to whether the probe find life there or not and send back incredible color panorama of its surrounding one thing scientist learn be that mars sky be pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally think the sky be pink due to sunlight reflect off the reddish dust particle in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among field of red sand and boulder stretch out as far as its camera could image the viking orbiter keep function until august when it run out of attitude control propellant the lander be switch into weather report mode where it have be hope it would keep function through but after november an errant command have be send to the lander accidentally tell it to shut down until further order communication be never regain again despite the engineer effort through may of an interesting side note viking lander have be designate the thomas mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington be entrust with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attach to the lander by manned expedition viking be launch on september and arrive in martian orbit on august the lander touch down on september in utopia planitia it accomplish essentially the same task as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer work record one marsquake the orbiter have series of attitude control gas leak in which prompt it be shut down that july the lander be shut down on april the orbit of both viking orbiter should decay around voyager outer planet flybys voyager be launch september and fly past jupiter on march and by saturn on november voyager be launch august before voyager and fly by jupiter on august by saturn on august by uranus on january and by neptune on august voyager take advantage of rare once year alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet voyager could in principle have head towards pluto but jpl opt for the sure thing of titan close up between the two probe our knowledge of the giant planet their satellite and their ring have become immense voyager discover that jupiter have complicate atmospheric dynamic lightning and aurorae three new satellite be discover two of the major surprise be that jupiter have ring and that io have active sulfurous volcano with major effect on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probe reach saturn they discover over ringlet and satellite include the predict shepherd satellite that keep the ring stable the weather be tame compare with jupiter massive jet stream with minimal variance year great white spot band cycle be know titan atmosphere be smoggy mimas appearance be startling one massive impact crater give it the death star appearance the big surprise here be the strange aspect of the ring braid kink and spoke be both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager thank to heroic engineering and programming effort continue the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself be highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity be that its magnetic axis be find to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis give uranus peculiar magnetosphere icy channel be find on ariel and miranda be bizarre patchwork of different terrain satellite and one more ring be discover in contrast to uranus neptune be find to have rather active weather include numerous cloud feature the ring arc turn out to be bright patch on one ring two other ring and other satellite be discover neptune magnetic axis be also skewed triton have canteloupe appearance and geyser what be liquid at the two voyager be expect to last for about two more decade their on target journeying give negative evidence about possible planet beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause soviet planetary mission since there have be so many soviet probe to the moon venus and mars will highlight only the primary mission soviet lunar probes luna lunar impact attempt in miss moon and

computer error phobos attempt to land probe on martian moon phobos the probe do enter mars orbit in early but signal cease one week before schedule phobos landing while there have be talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even interstellar probe within the next thirty year no major step have yet be take with these project more intensive study of the moon mars venus and various comet have be plan for the and mercury mission to orbit and land probe on the tiny world have be plan for how the many change in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states will affect the future of their space program remain to be see japanese planetary missions sakigake ms be launch from the kagoshima space center by isas on january and approach halley comet within about million km on march the spacecraft be carry three instru ment to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma wave solar wind all of which work normally now so isas make an earth swingby by sakigake on january into an orbit similar to the earth the close approach be atst utc on january the geocentric distance be km this be the first planet swingby for japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observe the geotail some geotail passage will be schedule in some year hence the second earth swingby will be on june at re earth radius and the third october at re hiten small lunar probe be launch into earth orbit on january the spacecraft be then know as muses but be rename to hiten once in orbit the lb probe loop out from earth and make its first lunary flyby on march where it drop off its lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at this point become the third nation to orbit satellite around the moon join the unites states and ussr the small spacecraft hagoromo remain in orbit around the moon an apparently break transistor radio cause the japanese space scientist but the spacecraft tracking transmitter fail immediately the rocket firing of hagoromo be optically confirm use the schmidt camera cm at the kiso observatory in japan hiten make multiple lunar flyby at approximately monthly interval and perform aerobraking experiment use the earth atmosphere hiten make close approach to the moon atst utc on february at the height of km from the moon surface and fire its propulsion system for about ten minute to put the craft into lunar orbit the follow be the orbital calculation result after the approach apoapsis altitude about km periapsis altitude about km inclination deg to ecliptic plane period day planetary mission reference also recommend read the follow work categorize in three group general overviews specific book on particular space mission and periodical source on space probe this list be by no mean complete it be primarily design to give you place to start your research through generally available work on the subject if anyone can add pertinent work to the list it would be greatly appreciate though naturally recommend all the book list below think it would be good if you start out with the general overview book in order to give you clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area also recommend that you pick up some good up to date general work on astronomy and the sol system to give you some extra background most of these book and periodical can be find in any good public and university library some of the more recently publish work can also

space probe mission it have launch good university library will carry these book and they be easily find simply by know which mission you wish to read about recommend these work after you first study some of the book list above some periodical recommend for read on space probe be national geographic which have write article on the pioneer probe to earth moon luna and the jovian planet jupiter and saturn the ranger surveyor lunar orbiter and apollo mission to luna the mariner mission to mercury venus and mars the viking probe to mars and the voyager mission to jupiter saturn uranus and neptune more detail on american soviet european and japanese probe mission can be find in sky and telescope astronomy science nature and scientific american magazine time newsweek and various major newspaper can supply not only general information on certain mission but also show you what else be go on with earth at the time event be unfold if that be of interest to you space mission be affect by numerous political economic and climatic factor as you probably know depend on just how far your interest in space probe will go you might also wish to join the planetary society one of the large space group in the world dedicate to planetary exploration their periodical the planetary report detail the late space probe mission write to the planetary society north catalina avenue pasadena california usa

letter be write you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution and extract the intent from the text the text of the second amendment be well regulate militia be necessary for the security of free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe the debate over this amendment have be whether the first part of the sentence well regulate militia be necessary to the security of free state be restrictive clause or subordinate clause with respect right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issue of political impact or public policy but be restrict entirely to linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent far since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regard the consequence of the second amendment ask that whatever analysis you make be professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary my letter frame several question about the test of the second amendment then conclude realize that be ask you to take on major responsibility and task with this letter be do so because as citizen believe it be vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while ask that your analysis not be affect by the political importance of its result ask that you do this because of that importance after several more letter and phone call in which we discuss term for his do such an analysis but in which we never discuss either of our opinion regard the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud send the follow analysis into which have insert my question for the sake of clarity copperud the word well regulate militia be necessary to the security of free state contrary to the interpretation cite in your letter of july constitute present participle rather than clause it be use as an adjective modify militia which be follow by the main clause of the sentence subject the right verb shall the to keep and bear arm be assert as an essential for maintain militia in reply to your numbered question schulman can the sentence be interpret to grant the right to keep and bear arm solely to well regulate militia copperud the sentence do not restrict the right to keep and bear arm nor do it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by other than the people it simply make positive statement with respect schulman be the right of the people to keep and bear arm grant by the word of the second amendment or do the second amendment assume preexist right of the people to keep and bear arm and merely state that such right shall not be infringe copperud the right be not grant by the amendment its existence be assume the thrust of the sentence be that the right shall be preserve inviolate for the sake of ensure militia schulman be the right of the people to keep and bear arm condition upon whether or not well regulate militia be in fact necessary to the security of free state and if that condition be not exist be the statement the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe null and void copperud no such condition be express or imply the right to keep and bear arm be not say by the amendment to depend on the existence of militia no condition be state or imply as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arm and to the necessity of well regulate militia as requisite to the security of free state the right to keep and bear arm be deem unconditional by the entire sentence schulman do the clause well regulate militia be necessary condition on the right of the people to keep and bear arm or be such right deem unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence copperud the right be assume to exist and to be unconditional as previously state it be invoke here specifically for the sake of the militia schulman which of the following do the phrase well regulate militia mean wellquip well organize well drill well educate or subject to regulation of superior authority copperud the phrase mean subject to regulation of superior authority this accord with the desire of the writer for civilian control over the military schulman if at all possible would ask you to take account the change meaning of word or usage since that sentence be write year ago but not take into account historical interpretation of the intent of the author unless those issue can be clearly separate copperud to the good of my knowledge there have be no change in the meaning of word or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it be write today it might be put since well regulate militia be necessary tot he security of free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be abridge schulman as scientific control on this analysis would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence well school electorate be necessary to the security of free state the right of the people to keep and read book shall not be infringe my question for the usage analysis of this sentence would be be the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the word modify each other identical to the second amendment sentence and could this sentence be interpret to restrict the right of the people example register voter with high school diploma copperud your scientific control sentence precisely parallel the amendment in grammatical structure there be nothing in your sentence that either indicate or imply the possibility of restricted interpretation professor copperud have only one additional comment which he place in his cover letter with well know human curiosity make some speculative effort to decide how the material might be use but be unable to reach any conclusion so now we have be tell by one of the top expert on american usage what many know all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally protect the people right to keep and bear arm forbid all government form under the constitution from abridge that right as write this the attempt coup against constitutional government in the soviet

proof before he be execute this proof be usually obtain in the form of confession at first every collaborator deny his crime so we start off by show the collaborator the testimony against he we tell

americans have be in the gladstonian and foreign missionary tradition the condition of the jews in turkey be almost mathematical demonstration that religious difference have have an influence in the tragedy of turkey only as they be combine with aspiration for political separation which every nation in the world would have treat as treasonable one readily reach the conclusion that the jews in turkey be fortunate he also state that they armenians traitorously turn turkish city over to the russian invader that they boast of having raise an army of one hundred and fifty thousand man to fight civil war and that they burn at least hundred turkish village and exterminate their population turkey and the holocaust an interview with stanford shaw history who recently complete two book the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic and turkey and the holocaust turkey role in rescue turkish and european jewry from nazi persecution shaw chair the undergraduate interdepartmental degree program in near eastern studies and have organize the program for the study of ottoman and turkish jewry he be affiliate with the von grunebaum center for near eastern studies editor how do you come to write these two book on turkey and european and turkish jews shaw basically be an ottoman historian but be also jewish have spend twenty five year study ottoman history and as time go along whenever find material on the ottoman jews collect they but never do anything with they until couple of year ago when suddenly realize that be the anniversary of the jews be expel from spain and come to turkey then the sephardic temple down on wilshire avenue invite to give series of three lecture on ottoman jewry these lecture be greatly appreciate and become motivated to undertake further research to develop book the jews of the ottoman empire and the turkish republic this book be quite different from the work of most jewish historian who tend to look at the jews in any country more from the viewpoint of the jews and the jewish community and rely mainly on jewish source view my subject as an ottoman historian and approach the jews of the ottoman empire largely from the point of view of ottoman society use largely ottoman source after finish this book and send it to the press come across additional document relate to turkish jews during world war ii in the complete book have say that turkey have do good deal to rescue the jews during world war ii but do not actually have many detail then find batch of document in the foreign ministry archive relate to action take by turkish diplomat to help the jews before and during the holocaust it be too late to add this new information to the book in press so decide to write second book conduct further research mainly in the archive of the foreign ministry in ankara and the turkish embassy and consulate in paris the result be the second book turkey and the holocaust which detail how turkey helped rescue jews from the nazis how exactly do they do this the story take place over number of year the book present the material in three part first of which deal with the period before the holocaust when the nazis come to power in germany in they immediately start dismiss jews and anti nazi germans from university hospital scientific institute and the like turkey at that moment be just begin the process of reform its university and it see in these jews who be be fire from their position in germany good source of new talent to help modernize the turkish university within three month after the nazis start dismiss these jews turkey arrange to take many of they in they be bring to turkey and be give appointment as professor in the turkish university as head of scientific institute and as medical personnel in hospital about to major jewish professor come to turkey in the ernst reuter german political scientist spend the war year teach political science in turkey after world war ii he be mayor of berlin during the berlin airlift fritz neimark major german jewish economist come to turkey and help establish modern school of economic in istanbul man name reichenbach who be rescue from the nazis by turkey and spend the war year in turkey eventually come to ucla where he become professor of philosophy other german jewish emigre engage in cultural activity in turkey one such be karl ebert who have be lead theatrical producer in berlin until he be expel by the nazis he go to turkey where he organize the turkish national theater and the turkish national opera company in ankara with the help of paul hindemuth so the first section of the book cover this first phase when jews be be persecute in germany and rescue by turkey oddly enough the german emigre when they be in turkey do not seem to think too badly of germany they regard themselves more as germans than jews and they do not join in the anti nazi activity of the local turkish jewish community even find letter from the nazi representative to turkey praise these german jewish refugee for their work in promote the idea of german culture even though these people have be persecute by the nazis and rescue by the turks they share the nazis feeling of aryan racial superiority over the turks the second part of the book deal with the holocaust which begin in when the nazis occupy france in europe at that time and especially in france there be about turkish jews they have migrate to europe for various reason from about the turn of the century onward most of they have settle in europe during the turkish war for independence after world war when greece be threaten to overrun turkey the greeks have persecute the jews throughout the nineteenth century and the jews fear what might happen to they if the greeks take over in turkey many jews flee turkish citizenship and become french citizen suddenly the nazis invade france in and start introduce all sort of anti jewish law the turkish jews soon find that it be not worth very much to be french jew but that it be worth lot how so turkey remain neutral through most of world war ii it retain its embassy and consulate in all the nazi occupy country until it finally enter the war on the side of the allies at the end of during the war therefore turkey be in position action that turkish diplomat take form the second chapter of the book turkish diplomat who be station in france in particular intervene to protect jews of turkish citizenship from the nazis for those turkish jews who have retain their turkish citizenship there be generally no problem if they be arrest and send to concentration camp the turkish diplomat would communicate with the commander of the camp and other official and say in effect these people be turkish citizen you can not do this to they and the turkish jews would be release if their business be confiscate the turkish diplomat would protest and the business would be restore the nazis in general want to keep the friendship of turkey they hope to be able to use turkey as gateway for an invasion of the middle east and they also want to obtain chromium and manganese from turkey in order to keep turkish friendship they usually accept these intervention on behalf of turkish jews the turkish diplomat sometimes go to the concentration camp train haul turkish jews to auschwitz for extermination and succeed in get they off the train most of the foreign jews be send to concentration camp at place call drancy in paris and that be where most of the intercession by turkish consul take place the great problem come with the turkish jews who have abandon their turkish citizenship and have become french citizen the consul could not declare that these people be turkish citizen because they be not my book include photograph of jews line up in front of the turkish consulate either to get passport to return to turkey or to get restoration of their turkish citizenship this be bureaucratic matter so process the application would take some time in the meantime it be real emergency because the nazis would arrest jews on the street for almost nothing the nazis would even arrest they if they have radio or telephone in their apartment because radio and telephone be forbid to jews to take care of these former turkish jews the turkish diplomat invent document call gayri muntazem vatandash or irregular fellow citizen the document say in effect this person be former turkish citizen who have apply for the restoration of his turkish citizenship in the meantime we would appreciate it if you would treat he as if he be turkish citizen the diplomat write the document in turkish and put their seal on it since the nazis could not read turkish on the whole they accept these paper as certificate of citizenship by this mean the turkish diplomat be able to rescue many jews who have relinquish their turkish citizenship actually the nazis be of two mind about the turkish defense of jews on the one hand the nazi foreign ministry which want to retain the friendship of turkey be in favor of accept these intervention on the other hand himmler andichmann want all jews exterminate at time himmler andichmann be able to prevail and some of the turkish jews be send off to auschwitz before the turkish consul could do anything do you have statistic on how many turkish jews be rescue there be about turkish jews in europe before world war ii about of whom be live in france most of the information in this section of the book relate to the situation in france have publish the letter that the turkish consul send to the nazi official and the letter that come back in reply generally the nazis say that if the turkish consul would present document certify that arrest individual be turkish citizen and promise to send they out of france the nazis would release they from the concentration camp the turkish consul also organize special train to take turkish jews from nazi occupy territory back to turkey these train run regularly in and the nazis give the turkish jews visa so they could pass out of nazi territory but the train be often hold up by the nazi influence government of eastern europe croatia serbia and bulgaria because these government really do not want the jews to escape as result of the turkish consul effort about to of the turkish jews in france be save another be send off to auschwitz where most of they die the remain either escape across the border into spain or flee to the area of southern france occupy by the italians who treat jews much well than the nazis do at the end of however italy fall out of the war and that be the end for those jews as well incidentally the turkish diplomat in nazi occupy greece also work to rescue jews in that country the second part of your book then deal with turkish diplomat act to rescue jews of turkish citizenship or turkish origin yes and there be an aside might add here in their intervention on behalf of turkish jews the turks cite their treaty with germany which state that turkish citizen in german territory would be treat the same as german citizen in turkey on that basis the turks maintain that the nazis could not discriminate against turkish citizen who be jews the nazis claim and the vichy government agree that they be not discriminate because they be treat all jews equally turkey protest say you be divide our citizen accord to religion but the turkish constitution require that all citizen be treat equally regardless of religion therefore you can not single out turkish jews american consul in paris by contrast accept the nazi argument and tell american jews who be be persecute by the nazis that they could not do anything about it because the american jews be be treat the same as other jews the third part of the book take place in turkey which be the principal center during the holocaust for activity aim at the rescue of eastern european jews the kwish agency an organization establish by jews in palestine to help resettle jews to palestine set up an office in istanbul in under the leadership of chaim barlas other jewish organization in palestine especially the kibbutz also send representative to istanbul to set up headquarter these group first try to contact jews in eastern europe to find out what be happen today we know about the holocaust but at that time people do not know what be go on they do not imagine the nazis could do the thing they be do and so the first step be to get information and the turkish government let they use the turkish mail to send letter to their relative and friend in eastern europe the jewish organization find out what be happen when they receive reply later on when the nazis begin to intercept such letter the jews receive assistance also from the vatican nuncio angelo roncali who serve as the vatican representative in istanbul from to and later become pope john xxiii as the vatican representative during the war he use the facility of the catholic church to supplement what the turkish government be do to assist jewish agency in contact jews in eastern europe with the cooperation of the turkish government these agency then send hard currency food clothing and even railroad and steamship ticket to jews in czechoslovakia bulgaria romania and hungary they be not able to help much in poland because by then the nazis have wipe out almost all the polish jews whenever possible the rescue agency arrange for the jews to get out of eastern europe either by train through the so call orient express route to istanbul or by boat through the black sea to istanbul turkey be not eager for all these refugee to remain within its border during the war because it be be blockade and be suffer terrible shortage of food and clothing the government therefore facilitate the movement of the non turkish jewish refugee from turkey to palestine either by the taurus express railroad through the mountain to syria and palestine or by small boat across the eastern mediterranean oppose not only by the nazis but also by the british who do not want any more jewish immigration to palestine because they fear it would hurt their relation with the arabs the british constantly pressure the turkish government to stop this traffic and send those jews back in few case the turkish government yield to british pressure do send the boat back for example in one incident the steamship struma with some jewish refugee from romania be send back by the turkish government as result of the intervention of the british ambassador when that ship be sink by soviet submarine all be lose except one person nevertheless all tell the turkish government allow no few than eastern european jews to pass through turkish territory and move on to palestine during the second world war the turkish authority also provide these refugee with facility and money and give they permission to send money and food out of the country many of these jews who pass through turkey may still be live in israel yes and their child but let us return for moment to the first group the turkish jews who come from europe they do not go on to palestine they stay in turkey it be the non turkish eastern european jews who pass through turkey en route to palestine their story be very interesting and you have rescue it from obscurity many study have be make of the holocaust but most of they do not focus on the eastern european or middle eastern jews most of the scholarship have center on the western european jews of whom million be massacre by the nazis my study deal with much small number of people have try to round out the picture and hope my book will persuade other scholar to undertake further investigation in the history of eastern jews when it come to number the german jews be also relatively small in number most of the million slay be polish jews the rescue of eastern european jews may not seem so significant compare with the total of million who be murder but it mean lot to those who be save about three fourth of the book consist of document translation of many document they be include because the story be not well known not only be people in the west unaware of the courageous action of the turkish diplomat even the people of turkey do not know the story feel that they would not fully understand this remarkable achievement unless they could see the document what language be use in the document most of they be in turkish or french some be in hebrew there be great deal of material in hebrew about the organization of the boat go to palestine the passenger and so on but do not go into those detail extensively describe mostly what turkey do so most of my document be in turkish or french few document be in english the jewish group in istanbul do not necessarily cooperate with one another to rescue jews in fact they often fight with one another they take turn try example some of the kibbutz group feel that the jewish agency be run by western european jews who be interested only in help western european jews finally in president roosevelt send personal representative ira hirschman who have be an executive of bloomingdale department store in new york city and hirschman manage to reconcile their difference the document relate to his mission be in english also obtain many document from sergelarsfeld holocaust historian in france who mainly work on the french jews his father be kill by the nazis he give material he have gather in the german archive on the turkish jews so do not personally consult the german archive believe that much more can be learn from the german archive and hope someone someday will make the effort this new book fit in well with your teaching do not it right be give course

who purchase high speed modem pep or hst discover the problem the first time they try to download file or accept an incoming fax at after upgrade the modem overrun and retry error abound even when the only active application be the datacomm or than with the old modem there be three reason for the problem the universal asynchronous receiver transmitters uart use in most pc be primitive device with single byte fifo buffer if the operating system driver can not read and flush each character at high interrupt rate the next incoming character overwrite the fifo and the previous one be lose dos be fairly single minded environment during datacomm can usually keep up window can not window have more operating system overhead than plain dos and interrupt often take long to service overrun be much more likely than under dos as soon as you report to your pc modem vendor that you be lose datum you may be advise that you need to upgrade to more likely since there seem to be conspiracy of ignorance about this issue you will get no useful advice at all most of the store front and mail order source speak with in attempt to solve my own problem have never hear the term and many do not even know what uart be even your pc have uarts and do or if you can upgrade your mother com board or add new com board you may still experience error and overrun because the standard microsoft windows com

themselves if you have modem card you may not have problem as the modem part of the card can be design to be aware of the state of the uart and avoid overrun it however would not want to bet that the card designer be that clever and will insist on uart if ever buy modem card some modem card do not even have conventional uart but if they be to work with standard windows driver they need to simulate

have the following limitation they enable only the receive fifo and only at rate above bps they never enable the transmit fifo which result in an interrupt rate of during upload they set the trigger level at byte too high it be easy for more byte to arrive before the driver can read the fifo the ports menu of the control panel only allow speed up to with modem sparse datum and text can easily compress or more suggest that host dte connect rate of bps would be effective the api will not accept rate above the api will not let dos program know there be there and even if it do dos program that be not aware get little benefit they do not allow irq sharing for the bios do not initialize properly in many system windows provide no workaround for app that do not provide port speed option above bps these problem be reportedly not solve in windows nt or dos and may or may not be address in any windows release after but before rumor suggest they may be solve in windows you can get replacement driver that solve all of those problem by buy copy of turbocom current version from bio engineering research pacific commware division beacon hill lane ashland or voice fax bbs mcimail compuserve price be around as recall bio eng be not set up to accept credit card so have to send check egghead and software list turbocom but as far as know they do not stock it bio be not software company per se they apparently need reliable hi speed serial connection for an in house instrument application write their own driver discover market for it revise it to be general purpose com driver suite they recently upgrade it for windows it be run time license now have my host dte connect rate set to bps most of my datacomm app and be have zero problem with download routinely see transfer rate that exceed bps be also use bps when link an to my pc with lossless bi directional uploads to various remote system be another matter because many host be still use antique uart and driver in control panel will allow in configure com port turbocom get around this by allow you to specify on each port factor that will set the real uart rate to multiple of the rate pass through the windows api and dialog box also have cts rts hardware flow control enable and suggest that you do the same even if you only ever transfer bit ascii datumonoff be not sufficiently reliable method of flow control the informal dec standard foronoffysteresis be that the sender may transmit another yes sixteen byte after receipt of theoff from the receiving system or device the byte fifo in the be clearly not big enough engineer have inform that the can not really do cts rts all by itself in the dos windows environment so use data rate above may still be risky even with hardware flow control with turbocom can still experience overrun in very busy system with lot of app run and serious swapping in progress if this be your situation you may need to buy co process com board but this will cost you more than turbocom upgrade review of two such board and review of turbocom can be find in the issue of windows sources magazine suggest try turbocom upgrade first and experiment with process priority and time slice if you be power user whose thrash system still run into comm problem closing soapbox comments the state of serial datacomm support be an embarrassment across the computer industry because it be the old standard interface the job of design hardware and writing software often seem to be assign to the least senior or low rank engineer at computer company the design of the average serial port be at least ten year behind the state of the art in my last job with major workstation vendor lobby for improve serial port when they be do the initial design of new system that family of machine be subsequently introduce with port however this be the exception few computer company seem to have any champion for decent you may as well learn what you can about serial because this situation show no sign of improve soon when fast arrive expect cry of outrage from windows user world wide whose pc sort of work today with but will fail miserably with fast without hardware buffer uart like the and

there be no english translation available however believe the technique he describe be know widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it be consistent with what one would expect of genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who write it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it be from that time and culture or be later forgery actually there be type of purportedly ancient document alleged actual holograph or early copy thereof for example the dead sea scrolls these can be test by various scientific mean to determine the age of the paper ink and object find with they this can provide pretty clear dating of the actual physical object document claim to be copy of ancient work although the copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find document which monk in monastary claim be copy of something generation of copist this be more of problem but can still be test although the test be not likely to be simple we can not expect test of the age of the physical object to tell we much so we must confine our testing to the text itself it be important to remember that none of these test can tell we if the document be really what it claim to be they can only date the document and identify its culture of origin for example have hear of letter suppose to have be write by jesus himself to king in what be now iraq if this document be to actually turn up scholar could date the paper and ink assume they have the holograph they could check the language content and writing style to see if they be consistent with what would be expect of palestinian jew of that time however even if all test result be positive there be no way to determine if jesus himself actually write it we would know what time and culture it come from but bar know sample of jesus handwriting or other clue for comparison scholarship must stop there there be seldom any way to determine who the actual author be as say be no expert onlas work do remember some of the test which can be apply to allege copy of ancient work specifically we might ask be the document internally consistent do it contradict itself if the work it be short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it be forgery the long the forgery the more difficult it be to maintain consistency for this reason most successful forger stick to short document be it consistent with the history and geography of the time again short non specific work might not be testable but if the writing be of any significant length no latter day forger would be able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous thing which someone from that culture would get right without even think about it but which later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check the devil be in the detail what about the literary style of the work figure of speech etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in way that seem strange to we be there any such odd phrase in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there be complication if the document have be translate or possibly even if somebody just update language when he copy it few case of language not from the culture claim may be allow in recent copy they cause problem and reduce certainty to be sure but do not necessarily prove forgery these test can be quite effective give enough material to work with but they be not easy they require the skill of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the question to ask be be every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claim origin if there be thing which do not fit how significant be they be problem area due to our lack of knowledge later change by copist or be they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture the end result of any such testing be occasionally certain particularly in the case of holograph or other ancient copy however often it may just be probability or an indication that the document or maybe part of it be probably authentic or sometimes maybe other part be late addition this be often unsettling to generation raise on tv where all problem be solve in to minute with time

well accord to project scientist michael werner light spacecraft revise orbit and short mission have add up to less expensive project with tremendous scientific power and bright future say werner design as follow up to the highly successful infrared astronomical satellite iras and cosmic background explorer cobe mission sirtf cryogenically cool observatory for infrared astronomy from space be schedule for launch in or if plan proceed as schedule iras pioneer work in space base infrare astronomy year ago allow astronomer to view the milky way as never before and reveal among other thing galaxy and comet it provide sky survey time more sensitive than any previously available from ground base observation cobe have measure the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scale and reveal new fact about the early universe but to illuminate sirtf potential jim evans jpl manager of astrophysics and fundamental physics pre project recently say that the project be to million time more capable than iras base on technological advance in infrared detector array however despite the enormous stride in infrared exploration sirtf promise and the fact that it be cite as the high priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the by the national academy of sciences it take diet or die directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project go accord to werner the project be now know as atlas sirtf base on the key factor in its new design the satellite will orbit the sun instead of the earth permit the use of an atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly propose and heavy titan the main advantage of the solar orbit be that you can use all of your launch capability for boost the payload you do not have to carry up second rocket to circularize the orbit werner say the other advantage to solar orbit he say be that it be in well thermal environment away from the heat of the earth additional major change in sirtf redesign include shorten the mission from five to three year and build spacecraft that be less than half as heavy as in the original plan atlas sirtf will weigh kilogram pound compare to titan sirtf kilogram pound all of that add up to less stressful launch environment werner say and cost saving of more than million for the launch in addition to increase saving in the design of the small less massive spacecraft werner say sirtf redesign come as result of congress tell nasa you be try to do too many thing if you want we how it fit into nasa overall strategy shortly thereafter sirtf be name as nasa high priority flagship scientific mission by the interdisciplinary space sciences advisory committee in addition to the blessing while the spacecraft and its instrument require descope always promise to come about from its advanced infrared detector array which will allow image to be develop ten of thousand of time fast than before accord to evans up until couple of year ago werner say all infrared astronomy be do with single detector or very small array of individually assembled detector since then the department of defense have develop program to produce array of ten or hundred of thousand of detector rather than just few and those be very well suited for use on sirtf werner note that in addition to deal with budget pressure congress be currently watch nasa project with an eye out for any technological spinoff on that question think we have some thing to say he say because the detector we be use be straight off various military development also sirtf will be build by the aerospace industry and it be real technological and engineering challenge in addition to be tremendous scientific project sirtf will be use by the entire astronomical community werner add but the revise three year mission put premium on observe time we have to educate the user community and develop program that involve early survey and quick turnaround of the datum werner say the downsizing of the project require reduction in scope and complexity of sirtf three instrument the infrared spectrograph infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer however these reduction will only result in loss of efficiency rather than capability he say the project hope to start phase activity in which will provide detailed concept for development and design build the hardware would begin about two year later project cost

advanced mental facility which have not develop religion as satisfactory explaination for the unexplained why be this so far it appear that only human have need to explain the unexplained why be this so the other animal on this planet include those with advanced mental facility seem perfectly content in their ignorance would like to point out that your presupposition scream out at only religion exist as crutch so that the unexplained need not be research religion be make up by human to address perceive need the biological aspect of human be deify that is all aspect of human life can be categorize in hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needless to say disagree with your strong opinion and the underlie presupposition disagree that christianity be an infectious cult it have certainly show itself to be persistent as belief system in spite of various persecution throughout the past two millenia that it continue to persevere do not demonstrate that it be infectious in derrogatory sense it may be that it provide workable system for its adherent and would argue that this be the case disagree that christianity be safety blanket which supplant hope and purpose rather it point an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there be nothing hide about christian source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you be the distinction between internally motivate hope and purpose and externally give hope and purpose be the apparent loss of control over one own life the problem or be it something else finally one do not appropriate eternal happiness by follow christian moral standard indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity be because standard be inadequate to save people christian the real power to moral living be give to the christian in the person of god spirit heaven be one of two final state that christian doctrine postulate however christians be generally not motivated to live accord to christian moral standard by this promise future reward rather they be motivate by the perceive benefit to they in the here and now many christian organization be concern with evangelism as priority and rightly so for it be jesus himself who give this as priority for his follower however it be not the penultimate priority as evangelism be normally understand preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism be generally well do through respect the opinion of other while demonstrate the very real benefit of christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compel the non christian to seek out the christian to ask why needless to say such demonstration be not easily accom plishe it take radical committment to the person of jesus it do not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian be require and it can not occur where no personal bond of friendship exist it be ineffective with stranger who can not evaluate the demonstration over time and it be easy to alienate or harm other if the sole purpose of be friend be to gain conversion as long time christian nearly year view with some skep ticism all evangelism program which incorporate hurry up attitude pressured conversion may ultimately be bad than no conversion at all because the pressured convert realize he be coerce and disavow christianity when they would have be open the bible state that it be the very spirit of god which bring conviction of wrong do to people be content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we be far more than animal we sleep eat reproduce and die just as other animal do true but we be also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself be so limited can only hope and pray that you will someday find more expansive view for reflection what animal have the wide variety of perform art that human do how be it that human can learn the language of other human or animal but that other animal can not do so how be it that human can organize themselves in various social structure whereas other animal have only one structurelatant assertion christianity be not physically addictive christianity be

combinedtm	50	46	question god exist religion life believe good use morality thing	9180	-	re atheist view on christianity be re accept jeesus in your heart the discussion begin why do the universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specify cause and effect seem to dictate at least to this layman mind there must be causal event no reasonable alternative exist would argue that causality be actually property of spacetime cause precede their effect and must concede here cause before effect imply time time be part of spacetime hense the argument would be valid could return and say that this do not infer the cause and effect relationship be unique address why which petri pikho address below also concede that be doubly remiss as assert no reasonable alternative exist an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated give time and further discovery by the scientist also understand that prove theory do not necessarily specify that this be how it happen but propose likely description of the phenomena in question be mistaken with this understanding but if you claim that there must be an answer to how do the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science have some good candidate for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith the fact that there be several candidate belie that none be conclusive with out conclusive evidence we be leave with faith it could even be argue that one of these hypothesis may one day be prove as good as non repeatable event can be prove but ask what hold someone today to the belief that any or all of they be correct except by faith couple of paragraph delete summary we ask why do the universe exist think this question should actually be split into two part namely why be there existence why anything exist and how do the universe emerge from nothing it be clear science have nothing to say about the first question however be it meaningful question after all would say it be not consider the following apparently it be for many person hence we have religion the question why anything exists can be counter by demand answer to question why there be nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both question turn out to be devoid of meaning thing that exist do and thing that do not exist do not exist tautology at its good carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first ask why while the second be request for definition it do not address why something do or do not exist but ask to define the lack of existence the second question be unanswerable indeed for how do we identify something as nothing be not they mutually exclusive term how do we identify state of non existence again this be near the limit of this simple layman ability to comprehend and would appreciate an explanation might add the worldview of thing that exist do and thing that don don be as ground in the realm of the non falsifiable as do the theist belief in god it be base on the assumption that there be not reason for be something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there be reason its very foundation exist in the same soil as that of one who claim there be reason we come to this either be therefore be or be for reason if the former be satisfactory answer then you be do for you be satisfied and need not doctor if the latter your search be just begin seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question time will tell some christians have talk to have say that actually god be himself the existence however see several problem with this answer first it inevitably lead to the conclusion that god be actually all existence good and evil devil and angel we and they this be pantheism not christianity agree it would lead to question their definition of christianity as well another answer be that god be the source of all existence this sound much well but be tempt to ask do god himself exist then if god be the source of his own existence it can only mean that he have in term of human time always exist but this be not the same as the source of all existence this do not preclude his existence it only seek to identify his quality imply he exist to have quality btw the good answer have hear be that human reasoning be incapable of understand such question be an atheist myself do not accept such answer since do not have any other method like the theist we come to statement of faith for this position assume that the evidence at hand be conclusive note be not argue against scientific endeavor for science be useful for understand the universe in which we exist but differ from the atheist in matter of perspective seek to understand what exist to understand and appreciate the art of the creator also have discover science be an inadequate tool to answer why it appear that pihko agree as we shall see but because tool be inadequate to answer question do not preclude the question assert that why be an invalid question do not provide an answer as far as can tell the very law of nature demand why that be not true of something outside of nature super natural this be not true science be collection of model tell we how not why something happen can not see any good reason why the why question would be bind only to natural thing assume that the supernatural domain exist if supernatural being exist it be as appropriate to ask why they do so as it be to ask why we exist my apology be use why as why do this come to be why do pre existence become existence why do pre spacetime become spacetime but we come to the admission that science fail to answer why because it can not be answer in the realm of modern science do that make the question invalid do not believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite have all of the part available just my opinion this opinion be also call vitalism namely that living system be somehow fundamentally different from inanimate system do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientist announce they have create primitive life say small bacteria in lab suppose we would do the same thing as when galileo or capernicus be vindicate before someone start jump up and down scream inquisition note say vindicate certainly hope we have get beyond the shoot the messenger stage pihko do present good point though we may need to ask what do as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shake by the production of evidence that shatter our sacred cow or will we seek to understand if new discovery truly disagree with what god say and continue to say in his word why do ask why apology to budweiser and company jason	['soc.religion.christian']

follow he all day adaptec txt darrylo rel darrylo hints and tips for the adaptec scsi adapter this document contain hint and tip for get the adaptec scsi adapter to work with various hardware and software package they be base upon my experience with an adaptec controller and will hopefully help other however note that can not guarantee that the following will really help you it work for and the information in this document could possibly cause you to lose some or all of your file on your hard disk important back up the entire content of your hard disk before try anything base upon information in this document copyright by darryl okahata this document may be freely copy for personal use only and may not be reprint in for profit publication without the consent of the author

note that part of this document contain technical and sometimes terse description of problem for reference adaptec technical support adaptec bbs please send comment correction etc via email to compuserve windows enhance mode the windows install program should automatically configure dos and windows for use with the adaptec however just in case something go wrong be go to describe some of the change need that instal windows make your pc run much slow even when you be not run windows method of speed it up be discuss in the section call window run slowly msdos configuration the windows install program add the smartdrive disk cache to your config sys and autoexec bat file if you follow the instruction you will notice that you will need to use double buffering with smartdrive this be the default setup you will also notice that your system run much much slow in both windows and msdos see the section call window run slowly for some way of speed your system up windows configuration section of the system ini file contain the entry virtualhdirq off believe that the windows install program automatically add this entry might want to try add some more line virtualhdirq off systemrombreakpoint false emmexclude cfff you probably do not need the above line though the systemrombreakpoint entry be use to enable support for memory manager like only need if you use such program window run slowly once you do get windows run with the chance be that your system be run much slow than before if it be not it be probably because you happen to be use version in your config sys file congratulation this appear to be win solution you be very lucky whether your luck will hold out remain to be see if your system be run much slow than before this be almost definitely cause by smartdrive with double buffering accord to the windows documentation and the microsoft technical note smartdrive double buffering require with you must use smartdrive with double buffering enable while this work it really slow down your pc once estimate that this slow my pc down by factor of five as consider this unacceptable look for other solution unfortunately you can not just disable double buffering if you do windows in enhance mode will not work and you might even destroy the content of your hard disk by try to run windows what you can do be one of the following use other driver that provide double buffering it be my opinion that the unbelievable slowness in smartdrive be cause either by horribly inefficient double buffering or by bug in smartdrive use driver that provideds serviceds stand for virtualma services this be standard which be support by windows that allow bus master disk controller like the to work with windows after trash my hard disk countless time find the follow solution none of which require use smartdrive note however that be now get occasional parity error which be probably not cause by these solution but might be see below while the following do not require smartdrive use some kind of disk cache utility be strongly recommend as this make windows run much much fast if you do not have the driver or you do not need aspi function for control cdrom tape drive more than two physical hard disk etc you can add the scsiha sys driver to your config sys file driver scsiha sys windows need the option this driver must be load into low memory it can not be load into high memory and it occupy about as of november the scsiha sys driver could be obtain from the adaptec bbs at hopefully it be still there if you need aspi function and have the driver version or you can use both the and scsiha sys driver in your config sys file driver driver scsiha sys amazingly enough the scsiha sys driver can also be load high assume you have dos would have think that this would crash my system but it do not ask adaptec technical support about this and they say that loading scsiha sys high should be fine as long as be load low on my system not use scsiha sys with would occasionally cause windows to crash upon restart or exit windows with the additional result of corrupt disk some of my windows grp file would be corrupt for these crash usually occur while make different program from progman exe the default windows shell and vice versa this be the reason scsiha sys may be necessary have absolutely no idea if scsiha sys be necessary with version of early than scsiha sys they do not seem to have any problem at all consider these people lucky other like have have all sort of problem in my opinion the good but not necessarily the easy solution be need unfortunately while you could get previous upgrade from the adaptec bbs the driver be not available from the adaptec bbs as far as know there be only three way to get copy you can buy the new as of november adaptecz scsi driver kit which supposedly include as well as other driver such as cdrom driver believe the list price be around if you already have copy of an old version of you can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it toz scsi for around copy of be include in central point pc tools for msdos note that the documentation and driver be store in different directory note far that only be include the cdrom driver and driver to support more than two hard disk be not include this be where obtain my copy of note however that be now get occasional parity error with windows in all probability defective hardware in my pc be cause this as upgrade my motherboard just after find the above solution however because these parity error occur only during disk access there be very small but definite possibility that the parity error be driver relate for example change the bus on off timing for certain disk transfer might cause this have run various memory test for hour at time and these test have find no problem this problem be probably cause by memory with marginal timing requirement which cause parity error during disk transfer this be why the memory test do not find any problem the problem show up only under disk however be mention this just in case it be not hardware problem floppy controller base tape backup device there be two possible problem with use the adaptec with floppy controller base tape backup device such as the colorado memory systems jumbo tape backup restore can take very long time the tape drive constantly start stop start stop etc tape operation may be erratic or encounter too many tape error this problem might be cause by defective hardware on my however have hear of other people have similar problem and so be mention this just in case it be not hardware problem on my tape backup restore take long time if you have floppy controller base tape backup device you may have to adjust the adaptec bus on off timing for good result when use the tape drive normally while do tape backup or restore the tape drive motor should be continuously run with only an occasional pause however the default bus timing on the adaptec may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop start and stop every few second this cause needless wear to the tape and tape drive however note that dirty tape head or defective tape drive can also cause this make sure your tape head be clean this also cause the tape backup or restore to take much much long than necessary the problem here be that these tape backup use the floppyma to transfer datum in memory to from the tape drive and the adaptec usema not feed datum quickly enough by the floppyma the tape drive stop rewind bit and restart once enough data be eventually feed to it the default bus timing on the adaptec which be reallyma timing be too large for example when backup be do datum have to be transfer from hard disk to memory and then from memory to the tape because the default timing on the adaptec hog the memory too much too much time be spend transfer datum from hard disk to memory not enough time be spend transfer datum from memory to the tape drive as result the tape drive constantly start and stop because data be not feed to it quickly enough the solution be to change the adaptec bus on off timing the default factory setting be microsecond on and microsecond off the bus on timing need to be lower to microsecond this can be do in one of two way if you have you can use the option for example use bus on timing of microsecond which mean that use the follow line in my config sys file device if you do not have your only recourse be to try to find program call setscsi exe which be very difficult to find the reason be that adaptec for reason of their own do not seem to want this widely distribute once ask someone who work for adaptec and they ask to not upload it anywhere if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet you could try use archie to hunt down copy believe that there be couple of site that have it if you do find copy you run it like so setscsi this adjust the bus on timing to microsecond run setscsi exe without any argument reset the bus time back to the factory default setscsi exe crash my system if be load could use setscsi exe with scsiha sys however do not lower the bus on timing below microsecond or increase it above microsecond if you low it too low the hard disk throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slow for microsecond work fine this value may work fine for you or you may have to adjust it downwards little once you have lower the bus on timing tape backup and restore should run fast also do not experiment with the bus on off time with the other option that have intentionally not describe unless you know what you be do bad combination can cause parity error and bad by starve memory refresh program call bustifix exe exist on the adaptec bbs unless this have be upgrade since last check which have be while this be self extract archive contain batch file and couple of other file this batch file be suppose to allow one to set the bus on off time for the and other however when try run this program with my my system crash at the time be run scsiha sys and do not check to see if there be conflict with it maybe this old program work only with the although the doc say that it work with the erratic tape operation or too many tape error this problem may or may not exist although it exist on my system hardware problem just on my particular could cause it however have hear of other people have similar problem and so be mention this just in case it be not hardware problem just on my symptom of this problem which persist even after clean the tape head back up to tape encounter unusable sector detect error result in an aborted tape backup tape backup work but the tape compare fail the tape drive start stop start stop etc much too often unlike the above mention problem tape backup restore take long time where the tape drive start and stop every few second this kind of start stopping occur every few second or so fastback plus do not find see any tape backup device other program like central point backup and the cms jumbo software assume that you have cms jumbo tape drive can find see the tape drive but fastback plus can not too many tape read error although do not know what be cause this problem discover that use different floppy controller solve it few month ago upgrade my motherboard which contain an integrate floppy controller as already have floppy controller on the initially disable the motherboard floppy controller after while decide to try disable the floppy controller and use the one on the motherboard when do this the tape drive cms jumbo reliability increase dramatically and fastback plus be suddenly able to find and use the tape drive do not know if this be cause by hardware problem on my on the one hand the floppy drive work great when they be attach on the other hand the tape drive do not work well attach to the floppy controller but it do work when attach to different controller this could be an indication of hardware problem on my do change floppy drive cable and so it be conceivable that the problem be in the cable do not know what the cause really be however if you be have similar problem you might want to consider try new floppy controller sound card many popular sound card can play or record digitize sound and this be typically do usema like the tape drivema the adaptecma can conflict with the sound cardma unlike that of the tapema this conflict usually manifest itself as parity error your system crash with parity error message what happen be that data be be transfer so quickly by the sound card and the adaptec memory refresh can not occur quickly enough which cause parity error usually get parity error mean that there be hardware problem with your system in this case however the parity error be not symptom of bad hardware have find that such parity error typically occur while record digitize sound and the chance of such error increase as you increase the record fidelity high sampling rate record in stereo record use bit instead of etc like the tape drive solution the solution here be to lower the adaptec bus on timing see the section on tape drive for information on how this be do note however that this may or may not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of parity error the software use to record digitize sound can greatly affect this problem some software be inefficient disk cache the speed of your hard disk and the amount of disk fragmentation can also affect this miscellaneous info this section contain miscellaneous hint tip and rumor much of it be merely information that have hear or read about and have not verify believe that the follow information be correct but be not sure use it at your own risk withemm and you need to specify the db parameter db unless you be use the driver if you do notemm will crash hang at bootup although theemm manual mention this the install program do not seem to detect that be present and automatically add this option to theemm command line at least this occur with theemm install program have not test any other version early version ofemm probably need this parameter but be not sure have never use version early than if you use you do not need to giveemm the db parameter some or all version of the do not support hard disk over one gigabyte in size to support hard disk with capacity over gb you need to get new rom bios from adaptec be not sure if this be still true of the late be sell by adaptec some driver note that some cdrom drive have proprietary interface non scsi these drive can not be use with the you have three choice for cdrom driver have no idea how well the follow solution work or even if they work the following be secondhand information you can buy adaptecz scsi driver package which list for something like if you already have old adaptec driver you can supposedly upgrade toz scsi for around contact adaptec for detail thez scsi package supposedly contain everything that you need you can buy the corelscsi driver package which be make by the same people that make coreldraw this package contain cdrom driver scsi tape driver worm driver etc do not know the list price but have see this package sell for around note that corelscsi do not come with the driver which be need if you do not already have you may be well off get adaptecz scsi instead this method be obsolete as the follow driver have be obsolete by adaptecz scsi kit but be mention it in case someone already have these driver you can use the driver in the adaptec kit and the kit aspi cdrom driver you will have to get copy of mscdex exe high level cdrom driver if it be not include in the kit but this be available from several bulletin board how to talk to scsi tape drive software that have hear about be again like the above section on cdrom drive have no idea how well the follow solution work or even if they work the following be secondhand information central point pc tools for msdos supposedly support large number of scsi tape drive it come with scsi driver as well as central point backup the corelscsi driver package contain scsi tape backup program see the above section on cdrom drive for more detail however note that corelscsi do not come with but require have see advertisement that sell the in three configuration scsi controller with hard disk rom bios scsi controller bios and adaptec aspi driver scsi controller bios adaptec aspi driver and corelscsi driver program imagine that adaptec now sell the in fourth configuration scsi controller bios andz scsi driver include aspi driver those people who use unix might be interested in version of gnu tar for msdos that talk to scsi tape drive via the driver you need this driver before you can use this program have never use this version of gnu tar but have hear that it work do not know how well though if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet copy can be find on and mirror site msdos dskutl aspibin zip gnu tar for scsi tape drive adaptec aspipat zip patch for aspibin relative to gnu tar aspisrc zip src for gnu tar for scsi tape adaptec ctrlr have no idea if copy can be find on compuserve unixforum might have it if any forum do as far as msdos be concern the and the controller be the same with msdos the should work as well as the however the hardware for these two board be not identical and there be at least one non msdos program that initially do not work with but do work with version of bsd unix in case anyone curious here be an edited copy of my config sys file files buffer break on stacks device device on ram romma st ffff dos high umb devicehigh

in azerbaijan near the nagorno karabagh region after the rumor start to the effect that in karabagh specifically in stepanakert an uprising have take place they say uprising in azerbaijani but do not think it be really an uprising just demonstration after that the unrest start several armenians live in thehdanov district be injure how be they injure they be beat even woman it be say that they be at the demonstration but they live here and go from here to karabagh to demonstrate after that feel uneasy there be some conversation about armenians among the local population the armenians have do this the armenians have do that right there at the site be attack couple of time by kid well true the guy from my crew would not let they come at with cable and knife after that feel really bad do not know where to go up and call home and my child tell there unrest everywhere be careful well have project go on tell the second secretary of the district party committee what have be go on and say want to take my crew off the site they would not allow it they say nothing be go to happen to you we have entrust the matter to the police we have warn everyone in the district nothing will happen to you well in fact they do especially detail we policeman to look after he know all the local people and would protect if something happen this man do not leave alone for five minute he be at work the whole time and afterward he spend the night with we too sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tell the situation be very tense be careful we finish the job at the site and leave for sumgait first

close off and the bus be not run bus normally leave baku for sumgait almost every two minute and suddenly no bus well we try to get there via private driver one man an azerbaijani say let us go find some other way to get there they find light transport vehicle and arrange for the driver to take we to sumgait he take we there but the other have say would not go if you give thousand ruble why because they be burn the city and kill the armenians there be not an armenian left well get hold of myself so could still stand up so we square it away the four of we get in the car and we set off for sumgait on the way the driver say in fact there be not any armenians leave they burn they all beat they all and stab they well be silent the whole odd mile be silent the driver ask how old be you old man he want to know if be be that quiet not say anything maybe it mean be an armenian how old be you he ask say be be too but call you old man say it depend on god each person life in this world be

at the city there be crowd of people walk down the middle of the street you know and there be no traffic well probably be scared they stop our car people be stand on the sidewalk they have armature shaft and stone and they stop we along the way the driver tell we how they know who be an armenian and who be not the armenians usually for example be an armenian but speak their language very well well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh be actually correct the pronunciation be different anyone who say pundukh even if they be not armenian they immediately take out and start to slash another one say there be car there with five people inside it he say they start hit the side of it with an axe and light it on fire and they do not let the people out he say they would not let they get out of the car only see the car but the driver say that he see everything well he often drive from baku to sumgait and back when they stop we we all get out of the car look and there be short guy his eye be gleam he have an armature shaft in one hand and stone in the other and ask the guy what nationality they be one by one we be azerbaijani they tell he no armenians here he do come up to when we be pull our thing out and say maybe you be an armenian old man but in azerbaijani say you should be ashamed of yourself and he leave turn and leave that be all that happen what be to do have home they stop we at the entrance to mir street that be where the kavkaz store and three large story building be that be the beginning of down town see that burn

and all the tank be outside the city cordone off sumgait walk on see two azerbaijanis go home from the plant can tell by their gait that they be not bandit they be just people walk home join they so in case something happen in case someone come up to we and ask question either of we would be in position to answer you see but avoid the large group because be local and might be quickly recognize

world and there be no perfect solution if one be go to resist tyranny then innocent people on both side be go to suffer and die do not say it be ok it be unfortunate but sometimes necessary would agree that it be evil in the sense that it cause much pain and suffering be not so sure that it be unnecessary as you say that conclusion can only be arrive at by evaluate all the factor involve and perhaps it be unnecessary as let us say we now know that do not mean that those who have to make the decision to bomb do not see it as be necessary rarely can one have full know of the consequence of an action before make decision at the time it may have seem necessary enough to go ahead with it but do not assume that feel the bombing be morally justify do not just do not condemn those who have to make difficult decision under difficult circumstance you certainly be not in such position if you be moral relativist as an absolutist be in position to judge but defer judgment wrong they be neither moral then nor now they seem necessary to those make the decision to bring quick end to the war simply refuse to condemn they for their decision one day will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum understand the full ramification of that and be prepared to do so do not believe that you can make the same claim and btw the reason bring up the blanket bombing in germany be because you be bemoan the iraqi civilian casualty as be so deplorable yet blanket bombing be institute because bombing be not accurate enough to hit industrial military target in decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing be the norm so the point be why make big stink about the relatively few civilian casualty that result in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilian proportionately and quantitatively die under the blanket bombing in even with precision bombing mistake happen and some civilian suffer but less civilian suffer in this war than any other iany other in history many iraqi civilian go about their life with minimal interference from the ally air raid the story of hundred of thousand of iraqi civilian dead be just plain bunk yes bunk the us lose serviceman in over four year and the majority of they be directly involve in fighting but we be expect to swallow that hundred of thousand of civilian iraqis die in war last about month and with the allies use the most precise bomb ever create at that what hogwash if hundred of thousand of iraqi civilian die it be due to action hussein take on his own people not due to the allied bombing regard jim	['alt.atheism']

so do not ask note such as refer to the reference list in the last part the section of this faq be available via anonymous ftp to rtfm mit edu as pub usenet news answer cryptography faq part xx the cryptography faq be post to the newsgroup sci crypt sci answer and news answer every day content in mathematical term what be private key cryptosystem what be an attack what be the advantage of formulate all this mathematically why be the one time pad secure what be ciphertext only attack what be know plaintext attack what be choose plaintext attack in mathematical term what can you say about brute force attack what be key guess attack what be entropy in mathematical term what be private key cryptosystem private key cryptosystem consist of an encryption system and decryption system the encryption system be collection of function index by key map some set of plaintext to some set of ciphertext similarly the decryption system be collection of function such that for every plaintext that be succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext be accomplish use the same key index as be use for the correspond encryption of plaintext into ciphertext such system wherein the same key value be use to encrypt and decrypt be also know as symmetric cryptoystem what be an attack in intuitive term passive attack on cryptosystem be any method of start with some information about plaintext and their correspond ciphertext under some unknown key and figure out more information about the plaintext it be possible to state mathematically what this mean here we go fix function and of variable fix an encryption system and fix distribution of plaintext and key an attack on use assume give with probability be an algorithm with pair of input and one output such that there be probability of compute if we have and note that this probability depend on the distribution of the vector the attack be trivial or pointless if there be probability at least of compute if and here range uniformly over the possible ciphertext and have no particular relation to in other word an attack be trivial if it do not actually use the encryption an attack be call one ciphertext if two ciphertext if and so on what be the advantage of formulate all this mathematically in basic cryptology you can never prove that cryptosystem be secure read part we keep say strong cryptosystem must have this property but have this property be no guarantee that cryptosystem be strong in contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology be to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that cryptosystem be strong we say for example that cryptosystem be secure against all passive attack if any nontrivial attack against the system as define above be too slow to be practical if we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any passive cryptanalytic technique if we can reduce this statement the cryptosystem be not easy to break other part of cryptology be also amenable to mathematical definition again the point be to explicitly identify what assumption we be make and prove that they produce the desire result we can figure out what it mean for particular cryptosystem to be use properly it just mean that the assumption be valid the same methodology be useful for cryptanalysis too the cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumption often he can try to construct proof of security for system see where the proof fail and use these failure as the starting point for his analysis why be the one time pad secure by definition the one time pad be cryptosystem where the plaintext ciphertext and key be all string say byte string of some length and be just the sum let us say the exclusive or of and it be easy to prove mathematically that there be no nontrivial single ciphertext attack on the one time pad assume uniform an algorithm take two input and produce one output with some probability that whenever and then because the distribution of be uniform and independent of the distribution of must also be uniform and independent of but also the distribution of be uniform and independent of hence there be probability exactly that whenever and over all and thus fortiori be trivial on the other hand the one time pad be not secure if key be use for more than one plaintext there be nontrivial multiple ciphertext attack so to be properly use key must be throw away after one encryption the key be also call pad this explain the name one time pad what be ciphertext only attack in the notation above ciphertext only attack be one where be constant give only some information about ciphertext the attack have to have some chance of produce some information about the plaintext the attack be trivial if it have just as good chance of produce when give for random for example say and say be the first bit of we can easily write down an attack the guess attack which simply guess that be this attack be trivial because it do not use the ciphertext it have fifty fifty chance of guess correctly no matter what on the other hand there be an attack on rsa which produce one bit of information about with success use if it be feed random then the success rate drop to so this be nontrivial attack what be know plaintext attack the classic know plaintext attack have and depend only on in other word give two ciphertext and and one decryption the know plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption as produce information about the key but this be pointless the cryptanalyst generally care about the key only insofar as it let he decrypt further message what be choose plaintext attack choose plaintext attack be the first of an increasingly impractical series of active attack on cryptosystem attack where the cryptanalyst feed datum to the encryptor these attack do not fit into our model of passive attack explain above anyway choose plaintext attack let the cryptanalyst choose plaintext and look at the correspond ciphertext then repeat until he have figure out how to decrypt any message more absurd example of this sort of attack be the choose key attack and choose system attack much more important form of active attack be message corruption attack where the attacker try to change the ciphertext in such way as to make useful change in the plaintext there be many easy way to throw kink into all of these attack for instance automatically encrypt any plaintext as where be time key sequence number choose anew for each message be random number and be one way hash function here comma mean concatenation and plus mean exclusive or in mathematical term what can you say about brute force attack consider the follow know plaintext attack we be give some plaintext and ciphertext we be also give ciphertext we run through every key when we find such that for every we print if be big enough that only one key work this attack will succeed on valid input all the time while it will produce correct result only once in blue moon for random input thus this be nontrivial attack its only problem be that it be very slow if there be many possible key what be key guess attack what be entropy say somebody be use the one time pad but be not choose key randomly and uniformly from all bit message as he be suppose to for our security proof in fact say he be know to prefer key which be english word then cryptanalyst can run through all english word as possible key this attack will often succeed and it be much fast than brute force search of the entire keyspace we can measure how bad key distribution be by calculate its entropy this number be the number of real bit of information of the key cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within guess be define as the sum of where be the probability of key	['sci.crypt']

opinion on the hanging of judas reject that the scholarly opinion of the those scholar and then rephrase those scholar opinion on the subject and actually if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you will find that it do denote success those scholar do indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide be successful as point out recently check several lexicon greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida robinson greek and english lexicon of the new testament greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale greek english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian writings bauer arndt gingrich the new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher couple simply state hang oneself and couple be more explicit and state that apacgw mean specifically kill yourself by hang couple also note that the meaning of one the root word for apacgw be strangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidate the guy who suggest to david joslin that judas be hang upside down one of the good reference though robinson greek and english lexicon of the new testament not only state the translation it give both the root word the literal translation relate greek word which use the same root and also other present specific example of the word in greek literature to give further context the word apagchw have two root wordchw be the to strangle root and the root word apo mean literally away this root word be include in word which denote transition it can mean transition in placeg the greek word apagello mean to send message apo can also denote change in state and specifically the change from life to death robinson specifically make comparison to the word apokteiuo which mean to kill in literal mean the word apacgw mean to throttle strangle to put out of the way and implicitly denote change in life state ie away from life to death so while the word apacgw do mean to hang it specifically denote death as well thus robinson be quite specific when he state that it mean to hang oneself to end one life by hang he then note the the use of apacgw in homers odessy to denote context he present that example of apacgw as be use to explicitly mean suicide by hang now since there be perfectly good word for strangle without the add denotation of death and as you insist that the bible be write by god and every word be precicely correct you be stick with the complete meaning of apacgw ie since the word apacgw be use then death be denote as the result by the way note that mr decenso also present an example of apacgw greek and you have not show the original meaning of the hebrew ie the the hebrew say and die and thus whether it be simply echo in the greek it should also be point out that regardless of the add and die the correct translation would still be apacgw as the man do indeed die from strangulation redundant but correct far we have evidence that the septuagint be repeatedly rewrite and reedite which include version which contradict each other and such editing be not even necessarily execute by greeks thus be not sure that you can use the septuagint as it now stand as paragon of ancient greek so what you really need to prove your point mr decenso be an example in ancient greek of someone commit apacgw and survive otherwise would see you as simply make worthless assertion without correspond evidence now would note mr decenso that everytime go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrive exegisis pretty much find it false thus think that if you be go to add to the text something over and above what the source clearly say then you have well have an explicit greek or historical source to justify it by the way as to mr rose statement about tree around the potter field unless mr rose can show that these tree be two thousand year old or that there be year old stump there or have thousand year old description of the area which mention such tree then it be inappropriate for he to assert that the present placement of tree prove the location of the tree two thousand year ago after all thing change now as to your other argument ie that the money judas use be not the same as the silver true peter or the author of acts do not specifically call judas betrayal an iniquity but for that matter neither do john specifically call judas action an iniquity either far john do not say that judas take the money box but rather say some think that because judas have the money box jesus be tell he buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something it be night box thus when see your explanation it still seem to you would choose the an unproven iniquity mention by another author in different book write at different time over the iniquity explicitly mention by the author of act find this force and contrive of course this particular argument become moot since we have have see evidence that apacgw mean suicide you see since judas hanging be successful he could not have spend the money mention in john because matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal be on the high holy day ie passover and thus he could not have spend the money before kill himself the next day thus the money which buy the field of blood would have to have be the piece of silver of course he get the piece of silver that night as well and thus could not have spend that either oh dear believe that the house of card be comme down maybe we should at this point discuss now whether jesus be crucify on friday or saturday as that be now part of the argument about judas by the way as to where the prophesy of the potter field come from ie the mention of it in matthew you say be remind you now to discuss it now it be all part of the same verse we be discuss and wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestep these issue later dave butler wise man proportion his belief to the evidence david hume philosopher an inquiry concern human understanding ps would note again that you be not state that that bible be not possibly inerrant you be state that it be inerrant since you have be by your own admission present merely possible reconciliation of course do not rate they that highly then the good you can do be say that the bible be possibly inerrant not that it be inerrant	['talk.religion.misc']

so as to hit people over the head with baseball bat yet the fact remain there be place call hell place so fearful that god die to save we from have to experience it whatever you or as christians do we should do whatever we can to win people to the lord if for no other reason to keep they from go jesus in mt tell we that he do not prepare hell for people he prepare it for the devil and his angel no

over in the synoptic matthew mark and luke jesus talk about hell not isaiah not moses not john the baptist though he do but jesus the son of god the great beloved one preach about hell because he love people and do not want to see they go there now if there be no hell then jesus preach in vain it be our lord jesus not some angry baptist preacher that say where the worm never die and where the fire never go out jesus say that it be jesus who call hell furnace of fire it be jesus that use the word condemnation and this be the condemnation that man love darkness rather than light because their

of courage and some writing ability to aid they and can take that all the way down to our present caliph whose feeble support of the law of thelema be laughable at well would be throw out of the order

but would like to put my two cent worth in while there be nothing wrong with revolver especially large frame in magnum my favorite there be valid advantage to semi auto suggest read massadyoob know some people can not stand he and think he be full of bull but think that in general his material be very valid and useful book the semi auto pistol in police work or something like that he define number of way that semi auto be different and that different be good the main advantage be not in increase firepower but in more accurate followup shot when you go to single action mode there be also certain propriatory nature of each gun that take some familiarity to learn this may have diminish with time as more criminal become familiar with different model of semi auto but it be cite as stop or at least slow down criminal who have grab police officer gun yes but this be well do with two hand hold with single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action the da semi auto have the same advantage plus be always sa after the first shot be not sure if this be mean to be different from your first point in da semi auto you can pull the trigger again to try drop the hammer on the same round an advantage you do not have in revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round discuss this point now this be fine with dud but what about hangfire situation grant it be very rare but your round will now go off confine in the cylinder with no place to go slingshotte the slide on misfire take very little time actually with modern revolver design incorporate hammer block this be not necessary or usually recommend revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off the good speedloader user especially those use the spring load speed loader be very fast problem be thatject the spent case be two handed job where drop the expended magazine be one hand this mean that while you can be insert fresh magazine as soon as the old one clear the gun with speed loader you have to go through more motion that will always take more time you also do not have the advantage of tactical reload replace partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be use if need later yes the time to recognize the problem be just as important as the time to clear it really though in either revolver or semi auto the odd of an actual misfire with factory ammo be awfully small you be more likely to get jam in semi auto but even these be exceptionally rare with modern quality gun sigslocks et al all common semi auto can be carry with round in their chamber without any safety problem while put that out as statement that believe should say that this apply to all of the one have look at for the da semi be it be no different from the revolver situation the gun all have hammer or fire pin block they also have safety because there be no real advantage carry one of these cocked and lock you have the same safety and speed of employment as revolver plus the advantage of sa followup shot be not familiar with sa semi auto except for the admit that be initially skeptical about carry this cocked and locked but after examine the design try to defeat the safety gun unload of course and shoot it lot see no inherent safety problem with it especially in thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer this design also get you more speed for an accurate first shot than revolver yeah the infamouslock still can not figure out how it be bad than revolver for safety if you do not pull the trigger it do not go off imagine that if all your revolver shooting be do double action then you could pull thelock trigger far enough to fire before you realize it in addition if you have develop that nasty habit of keep your finger on the trigger when holstere your gun and rely on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blow off your foot then you would have problem when the hammer be not there think this be even okay for riot as long as it be small one have the poor man beretta taurus and consider it

meaning of the second amendment to the united states constitution that be the question ask brocki editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publishers who himself have be recommend to as the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system mr brocki tell to get in touch with roy copperud retire professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of american usage and style the consensus little research lent support to brocki opinion of professor copperud expertise roy copperud be newspaper writer on major daily for over three decade before embark on distinguished year career teaching journalism at usc since copperud have be write column deal with the professional aspect of journalism for editor and publisher weekly magazine focus on the journalism field he be on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster usage dictionary frequently cite he as an expert copperud fifth book on usage american usage and style the consensus have be in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since and be the winner of the association of american publisher humanities award that sound like an expert to after brief telephone call to professor copperud in which introduce myself but do not give he any indication of why be interested send the following letter be write you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution and extract the intent from the text the text of the second amendment be well regulate militia be necessary for the security of free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe the debate over this amendment have be whether the first part of the sentence well regulate militia be necessary to the security of free state be restrictive clause or subordinate clause with respect right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issue of political impact or public policy but be restrict entirely to linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent far since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regard the consequence of the second amendment ask that whatever analysis you make be professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary my letter frame several question about the test of the second amendment then conclude realize that be ask you to take on major responsibility and task with this letter be do so because as citizen believe it be vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while ask that your analysis not be affect by the political importance of its result ask that you do this because of that importance after several more letter and phone call in which we discuss term for his do such an analysis but in which we never discuss either of our opinion regard the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud send the follow analysis into which have insert my question for the sake of clarity copperud the word well regulate militia be necessary to the security of free state contrary to the interpretation cite in your letter of july constitute present participle rather than clause it be use as an adjective modify militia which be follow by the main clause of the sentence subject the right verb shall the to keep and bear arm be assert as an essential for maintain militia in reply to your numbered question schulman can the sentence be interpret to grant the right to keep and bear arm solely to well regulate militia copperud the sentence do not restrict the right to keep and bear arm nor do it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by other than the people it simply make positive statement with respect schulman be the right of the people to keep and bear arm grant by the word of the second amendment or do the second amendment assume preexist right of the people to keep and bear arm and merely state that such right shall not be infringe copperud the right be not grant by the amendment its existence be assume the thrust of the sentence be that the right shall be preserve inviolate for the sake of ensure militia schulman be the right of the people to keep and bear arm condition upon whether or not well regulate militia be in fact necessary to the security of free state and if that condition be not exist be the statement the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be infringe null and void copperud no such condition be express or imply the right to keep and bear arm be not say by the amendment to depend on the existence of militia no condition be state or imply as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arm and to the necessity of well regulate militia as requisite to the security of free state the right to keep and bear arm be deem unconditional by the entire sentence schulman do the clause well regulate militia be necessary condition on the right of the people to keep and bear arm or be such right deem unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence copperud the right be assume to exist and to be unconditional as previously state it be invoke here specifically for the sake of the militia schulman which of the following do the phrase well regulate militia mean wellquip well organize well drill well educate or subject to regulation of superior authority copperud the phrase mean subject to regulation of superior authority this accord with the desire of the writer for civilian control over the military schulman if at all possible would ask you to take account the change meaning of word or usage since that sentence be write year ago but not take into account historical interpretation of the intent of the author unless those issue can be clearly separate copperud to the good of my knowledge there have be no change in the meaning of word or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it be write today it might be put since well regulate militia be necessary tot he security of free state the right of the people to keep and bear arm shall not be abridge schulman as scientific control on this analysis would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence well school electorate be necessary to the security of free state the right of the people to keep and read book shall not be infringe my question for the usage analysis of this sentence would be be the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the word modify each other identical to the second amendment sentence and could this sentence be interpret to restrict the right of the people example register voter with high school diploma copperud your scientific control sentence precisely parallel the amendment in grammatical structure there be nothing in your sentence that either indicate or imply the possibility of restricted interpretation professor copperud have only one additional comment which he place in his cover letter with well know human curiosity make some speculative effort to decide how the material might be use but be unable to reach any conclusion so now we have be tell by one of the top expert on american usage what many know all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally protect the people right to keep and bear arm forbid all government form under the constitution from abridge that right as write this the attempt coup against constitutional government in the soviet union have fail apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny be strong than the old guard desire to maintain monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united states elect lawmaker judge and appoint official who be pledge to defend the constitution of the united states ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizen be put in american prison for carry arm own arm of forbidden sort or fail to satisfy bureaucratic requirement regard the owning and carrying of firearm all of which be an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arm guarantee by the constitution and even the american civil liberties union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of rights stand by and do nothing it seem it be up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arm to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg our elect representative not to take away our right and continue regard they as represent we if they do will we continue obey judge who decide that the second amendment do not mean what it say it mean but mean whatever they say it mean in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the arm of our choice as the constitution of the united states promise we we can and pledge that we will defend that promise with our life our

following matthew think not that have come to abolish the law and the prophet have come not to abolish they but to fulfil they matthew for truly say to you till heaven and earth pass away not an iota not dot will pass from the law until all be accomplish matthew whoever then relax one of the least of these commandment and teach man so shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven but he who do they and teach they shall be call great in the kingdom of heaven matthew for tell you unless your righteousness exceed that of the scribe and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there be several problem with this the most serious be that the law be regard by jews at the time and now as bind on jews but not on gentiles there be rule that be bind on all human being the so call noachic law but they be quite minimal the issue that the church have to face after jesus death be what to do about gentile who want to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on they do not say that the law be abolish it simply acknowledge that fact that it do not apply to gentiles this be simple answer which think just about everyone can agree to discussion of the issue in more or less these term be record in acts however there be more involved in order to get full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grip with paul apparent rejection of the law and how that relate to jesus commendation of the law at least as read paul he say that the law serve purpose that have be in certain sense supercede again this issue be not one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul note that he might be understand this way and assure we that that be not what he intend to say rather he see the law as primarily be present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it be an impossible standard and one that have be supercede by christ paul comment be not the world clear here and not everyone agree with my reading but the interesting thing to notice be that even this radical position do not entail an abolition of the law it still remain as an uncompromise standard from which not an iota or dot may be remove for its purpose of convicting of sin it be important that it not be relax however for christians it be not the end ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical category they use be rather different in the end think jesus and paul come to rather similar conclusion the quote passage from mat should be take in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus show we how he interpret the law the not an iota or dot would suggest rather literal reading but in fact that be not jesus approach jesus interpretation emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial detail indeed he be well known for take rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher law some scholar claim that mat need to be take in the context of cent jewish discussion jesus accuse his opponent of care about give tenth of even the most minor herb but neglect the thing that really matter justice mercy and faith and care about how cup and plate be clean but not about the fact that inside the people who use they be full of extortion and rapacity mat this and the discussion later in mat suggest that jesus have very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talk about maintain the law in its full strength he be think of these aspect of it paul conclusion be similar while he talk about the law be supercede all of the specific example he give involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he be quite concerned about maintain moral standard the net result of this be that when paul talk about the law be supercede and jesus talk about the law be maintain believe they be talk about different aspect of the law paul be embroil in argument about circumcision as be natural in letter respond to specific situation he be look at the aspect of the law that be currently cause trouble the law as specifically jewish ceremony he certainly do not intend to abolish divine standard of conduct on the other hand when jesus commend the law he seem human relationship and deemphasize those aspect that be later it be unfortunate that people use the same term in different way but we should be familiar with that from current conflict look at the way term like family value take on special meaning from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future try to figure out why family value should be use as code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the think law have take on similar role in the argument paul be involve in paul be clearly not reject all of the jewish value that go along with the term law any more than people who concern about the family value

archishop lefebvre in particular he write it around the first part of the two part article be on the scandalous activity of archbishop weakland in this country but cut all that and pare down the rest to what be relevant joe buehler schism and disobedience accord to st thomasquinas schism consist primarily in refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the member of the church unite to he on first sight it would appear that whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop as discuss above he must be in state of objective schism as he have refuse to submit to the pope on very grave matter involve his supreme power of jurisdiction however standard catholic textbook of theology make it clear that while all schism involve disobedience not all act of disobedience be schismatic if this be so as be note at the beginning of this article it would mean that the number of american bishop who be not schismatic would not reach double figure the distinction between disobedience and schism be make very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique the article be by father yves congar who be certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre he explain that schism and disobedience be so similar that they be often confused father congar write that schism involve refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church for example luther rejection of the papacy father congar explain that the refusal to accept decision of legitimate authority in particular instance do not constitute schism but disobedience the catholic encyclopedia explain that for catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend to sever himself from the church as far as in he lie it add that not every disobedience be schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superior denial of their divine right to command not only do mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command but he affirm repeatedly his recognition of the pope authority and his intention of never break away from rome the archbishop make his attitude clear in the july august issue of day we pray for the pope every day nothing have change with the consecration last june we be not sedevacantist we recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the catholic church we do not even say that he be heretical pope we only say that his modernist action favor heresy intrinsically schismatic the principal argument use by those claim that mgr lefebvre be in schism be that the consecration of bishop without papal mandate be an intrinsically schismatic act bishop who carry out such consecration it be claim become ipso facto schismatic this be not true if such consecration be an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involve the penalty of excommunication in the code of canon law the offence be punish only by suspension see canon of the code pope pius xii have raise the penalty to excommunication as response to the establishment of schismatic church in china the consecration of these illicit chinese bishop differ radically from the consecration carry out by mgr lefebvre as the profess intention be to repudiate the authority of the pope that is to deny that he have the right to govern the church and the illicitly consecrate chinese bishop be give mandate to exercise an apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishop he have consecrate claim that they have power of jurisdiction they have be consecrate solely for the purpose of ensure the survival of the society by carry out ordination and also to perform confirmation do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr lefebvre the consecration of bishop without papal mandate be far more serious matter than the ordination of priest as it involve refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belong by divine right to the roman pontiff but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflict the church could not be more grave and that grave measure be need in response it appear to be take for grant by most of the archbishop critic that he be excommunicate for the offense of schism and the vatican have certainly be guilty of foster this impression there be not so much as modicum of truth in this allegation the new code of canon law include section begin with canon entitle penalties for specific offenses de poenis in singula dicta the first part deal with offense against religion and the unity of the church de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem canon deal with the offense of schism which be evidently together with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offense against the unity of the church but the archbishop be not excommunicate under the term of this canon or indeed under any canon involve an offense against religion or the unity of the church the canon cite in his excommunication come from the third section of penalty for specific offenses which be entitle usurpation of ecclesial functions and offenses in their exercise de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis the canon in question be canon which read bishop who consecrate someone bishop and the person who receive such consecration from bishop without pontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiae excommunication reserve to the holy see the scandalous attempt to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism be then contrary to both truth and charity comparable smear under civil as oppose to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involve massive damage an accurate parallel would be to state that man convict of manslaughter have be convict of first degree murder must stress that what have write here be not the dubious opinion of layman unverse in the intricacy of canon law canon lawyer without the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiate the charge of schism make against he as totally untenable father patrick yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris note in the july issue of valeurs actuelle that as have just explain mgr lefebvre be not excommunicate for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function he add that it be not the consecration of bishop which constitute schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop it be this usurpation of the power of the sovereign pontiff which prove the intention of establish parallel church cardinal rosalio lara president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law comment on the consecration in the july issue of la repubblica it would be hard to the act of consecrate bishop without papal mandate be not in itself schismatic act in fact the code that deal with offense be divide into two section one deal with offense against religion and the unity of the church and these be apostasy schism and heresy consecrate bishop with pontifical mandate be on the contrary an offense against the exercise of specific ministry for example in the case of the consecration carry out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc in and although the archbishop be excommunicate he be not consider to have commit schismatic act because there be no intention of breach with the church it be not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrate bishop without papal mandate archbishop lefebvre have the least intent of establish schismatic church he be not schismatic and will never be schismatic the archbishop consider correctly that the the church be undergo its bad crisis since the arian heresy and that for the good of the church it be necessary for he to consecrate the four bishop to ensure the future of his society canon law provide for just such situation and even if one believe that the future of the society could have be guarantee without these consecration the fact that the archbishop believe sincerely that it could not mean as canon law state clearly that he have not incur excommunication furthermore while the vatican allow such prelate as archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it can not expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanction against great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life have be devote to the service of the church and the salvation of soul dr eric de saventhem president of the international una voce association be one of the well inform layman in the church and he know the archbishop intimately dr de saventhem like myself have no great desire than to see reconciliation between mgr lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop lifetime quotation from statement by dr de saventhem which be publish in the february remnant merit careful study in retrospect the road lead to the consecration of june appear more paved with grave roman and unfortunately also papal omission than with lefebvrist obstinancie and from the eye of an inform public this can not be hide by attempt to present the archbishop act of grave disobedience as an offense against the faith it be say today that mgr lefebvre have an erroneous concept of tradition if this be so cardinal ratzinger could not on behalf of the pope have address to the archbishop the follow word in his letter of july your ardent desire to safeguard tradition by procure for it the mean to live and prosper testifie to your attachment to the faith of all time the holy father understand your concern and share

operations of rimsat be invite to speak at an informal lunch hold by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis be an organization on campus that deal with arms control disarmament and international security rimsat be consider an appropriate topic because the company be use russian launcher and satellite think it also help that his daughter be grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently begin when matt neilson go to tonga who happen to be big tv fan matt buy the king satellite dish which the king think be really nifty since tonga havenp of about million his majesty ask if there be any way to make money off this matt think there probably be so at his suggestion tonga apply for geosynchronous satellite slot while this be not entirely off the wall it be very unusual see as tonga be tiny kingdom with no space program and be lot of slot the whole thing be debate in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who be apparently respected space lawyer write several opinion support tonga case eventually tonga end up with slot range from to slot be designate by the longitude over which they reside accord to sternberg four of these from to be the good in the world because they be excellently place for communication between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat be form to use these slot it be officially form in nevis as tax haven they try for few year to raise fund in the west however to fill slot with western satellite launch on western launcher would have cost approximately billion it be not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of use russian hardware they begin negotiate withlavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describe operate in moscow in such harsh term that do not think will visit there for long time besides significant lack of creature comfort he be not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper document and license that indicate they be the only one who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arrange deal withlavkosmos for satellite at cost of million howeverlavkosmos lose favor after the coup sternberg say that this be because they be basically bunch of kgb operative who go to trade show and pick up lot of brochure sincelavkosmos be out of power he have to renegotiate the deal with the new authority he again describe life in moscow hotel in rather unfavorable term eventually he work out deal and on dec he meet with koptev who head the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insist on few concession before sign and accord to sternberg he arrange these new rule to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step be to meet with the builder of the hardware npo applied mechanics npo pm to use their acronym this organization be locate in siberia can not figure out how to spell the town need an atlas and have build about vehicle since the dawn of the space age sternberg comment that siberian be very different from musovites they be hard worker honest people who team up to get thing do very much like midwesterner at this point there be some comment from the audience that agree with his opinion on both siberian and midwesterner sternberg have lot of good thing to say about npo pm his company be apparently lookng for million to invest in the firm to become partner it apparently cost the russians about million to build satellite that would sell for million in the west if you want to give they specification they will build you satellite for the particular satellite that rimsat will be use cost run about per transponder year this compare to in the they can sell their time for about million compare to million in the rimsat will launch their satellite on protons to get the good price they buy in bulk they have the right to twelve launch so if any of you need lift can give you their address the first launch be schedule for october and they be get one use satellite from the russians which be be move into place now tidbit sternberg say this kind of thing have to be do by entrepreneur not big business because big business be just like what they have over there except that we have well paper both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launch be self insure the promise to replace fail launch within month major investor in rimsat include russell which be huge retirement fund organization cellsat which be big telecom business in southeast asia and fund operate by some of the big name in aerospace which he say be sort of an insurance policy for they if this really take off he downplay the instabilite in the ex ussr say that we be worry partly because we be not use to see russia as anything but an unvarye monolith italy get new government every two week but we do not worry because we be used to it he predict that once we get use to see what really go on in russia we will not worry about their stability as much part of the problem with cooperative venture be the problem of transfer money the central bank have policy of take hard currency payment put in their coffer and replace the rest with the equivalent value in ruble to get around this rimsat pay their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pay their contractor with foreign currency so that the only the contractor get swindle by the government one of the big problem rimsat have have be stonewall by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently buy three of the same type of satellite which be rather reassuring the big worry most people have about russian satellite be the primitive technology and short lifetime the old gorizont horizon satellite have lifetime of about year while the more modern express satellite compare well with western technology and last about year while this be much short than year for western satellite sternberg downplay the difference at these price they can afford to launch new one in addition short lifetime mean that they can replace their equipment with new technology so they will be able to compete well than old out

hold at jpl in early march and be intend to maintain cooperation between international space agency participate in the development of the spacelbi project recently approve jpl flight project set for launch in spacelbi will utilize two earth orbit spacecraft the japanese vsoplbi space observing program satellite with its meter radio telescope and russian radioastron meter satellite both spacecraft will team up with ground base radio telescope locate around the world to create radio telescope network that astronomer hope will expand radio telescope observe power by factor of japan vsop satellite will use limited six hour orbit to conduct image science while the russian radioastron spacecraft will exploit large hour earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy each satellite will point at source target for roughly hour while approximately ground base radio telescope will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on earth accord to dr joel smith jpl project manager for the spacelbi meeting like those hold at jpl will permit japan and russia who have little previous experience in radio interferometry to establish work relationship with the radio astronomy community that will be vital during the complex observation require by the spacelbi project one of our main activity be develop the methodology for international coordination because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking station while use the ground base radio telescope to observe the same celestial object say smith three new tracking antenna be be build at dsn facility and other three other tracking facility locate in japan russia and green bank va this global network of ground base radio telescope will use precision clock and high speed recorder to collect observation datum and forward the information to correlator locate at the national radio astronomy observatory in socorro the correlator will combine and process datum then make it available to mission investigator in moscow tokyo and jpl via electronic mail smith be optimistic that the massive radio telescope create by the spacelbi network will provide radio astronomer with well resolution than have ever be achieve before by ground base radio telescope allow astronomer to take close look at distant object in space there be long history of radio astronomy use ground base telescope say smith what we intend to do be to extend radio astronomy into earth orbit our goal be to look deeply into the core of galactic nucleus quasar and other active radio source to understand what drive those thing we have see so far with radio astronomy smith note that if one examine the active galactic nucleus you will find jet appear to spew at speed great than light and at energy level that be million of time great than you would expect he say some astronomer believe that black hole may be locate in the core of these galaxy and that they may fuel the jet smith hope that by use spacelbi to look far into the core this theory may be support or disprove russian space flight hardware include transponder and transmitter be now be test in the united states and japanese hardware be schedule to arrive for testing later this year analysis of this hardware will permit scientist and engineer to understand how to modify the high speedlba correlator operate at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd datum pattern that will originate from the more than ground base radio telescope involve in spacelbi smith be particularly please that meeting with the japanese and russian space agency official like those hold at jpl in march have proceed smoothly yet he know that the political uncertainty in russia could jeopardize that country participation in the project nothing be ever smooth he say but the russians have be incredibly open with we we always anticipate some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factor beyond our control yet there tend to be way of keep these thing go because scientist on both side be try hard and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level smith point out that the japanese space agency have more at stake than just fulfil an international commitment to science mission the japanese have be extremely cooperative since international cooperation be essential to their science mission he say but smith also note that japanese space agency official look at the spacelbi mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involve with vsop spacecraft and their highly regard mach launch vehicle yet regardless of the risk involve in undertake such an ambitious project jpl smith be satisfied that planning for the spacelbi project be beyond the significant financial and political hurdle that otherwise might threaten

contact white house office of the press secretary washington april follow be remark by president clinton in question and answer session with the press edt the president on february the four federal agent be kill in the line of duty try to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which have illegally stockpile weaponry and ammunition and place innocent child at risk because the batf operation have fail to meet its objective day standoff ensue the federal bureau of investigation then make every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life the bureau effort be ultimately unavaile because the individual with whom they be deal david koresh be dangerous irrational and probably insane he engage in numerous activity which violate both federal law and common standard of decency he be moreover responsible for the death and injury which occur during the action against the compound in february give his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostage no provocative action be take for more than seven week by federal agent against the compound this weekend be brief by attorney general reno on an operation prepare by the fbi design to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan include decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it be hope force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender be inform of the plan to end the siege discuss it with attorney general reno ask the question think it be appropriate for to ask then tell she to do what she think be right and take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday action end in horrible human tragedy mr koresh response to the demand for his surrender by federal agent be to destroy himself and murder the child who be his captive as well as all the other people who be there who do not survive he kill those he control and he bear ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensue now we must review the past with an eye towards the future have direct the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happen and why and whether anything could have bene differently have tell the department to involve independent professional law enforcement official in the investigation expect to receive analysis and answer in whatever time be require cooperate fully with all congressional inquiry so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agent on the front line who do the good job they could under deeply difficult circumstance again want to say as do yesterday be very sorry for the loss of life which occur at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco hope very much that other who will be tempt to join cult and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deter by the horrible scene they have see over the last seven week and hope very much that the difficult situation which federal agent confront there and which they will be doubtless require to confront in other context in the future will be somewhat well handle and well understand because of what have be learn now mr president can you first of all tell we why after day you decide mr president can you describe for we what it be that janet reno outline to you in your minute phone conversation with the president can not hear you both if one will go first and then the other sorry can you describe what janet reno mr president the president will answer both your question but can not do it at once can you describe what she tell you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you know about it the president yes be tell by the attorney general that the fbi strongly feel that the time have come to take another step in try to dislodge the people in the compound and she describe generally what the operation would be that they want permanent damage to adult or to child but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it be hope that the tear gas would permit they to come outside be far tell that under no circumstance would our people fire any shot at they even if fire upon they be go to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicle which would protect they and there would be no exchange of fire in fact as you know an awful lot of shot be fire by the cult member at the federal official there be no shot come back from the government side ask number of question the first question ask be why now we have wait seven week why now the reason be give be the following number one that there be limit to how long the federal authority could maintain with their limited resource the quality and intensity of coverage by expert there they might be need in other part of the country number two that the people who have review this have never see case quite like this one before and they be convince that no progress have be make recently and no progress be go to be make through the normal mean of get koresh and the other cult member to come out number three that the danger of their do something the passage of time and number four that they have reason to believe that the child who be still inside the compound be be abuse significantly as well as be force to live in unsanitary and unsafe condition so for those reason they want to move at that time the second question ask the attorney general be whether they have give consideration to all of the thing that could go wrong and evaluate they against what might happen that be good she say that the fbi personnel on the scene and those work with they be convince that the chance of bad thing happen would only increase with the passage of time the third question ask be have the military be consult as soon as the initial tragedy come to light in waco that be the first thing ask to be do because it be obvious that this be not typical law enforcement situation military people be then bring in help to analyze the situation and some of the problem that be present by it and so ask if the military have be consult the attorney general say that they have and that they be in basic agreement that there be only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military something that both side think be not of overwhelming significance having ask those question and get those answer say that if she think it be the right thing to do that she should proceed and that would support it and stand by that today mr president the president wait go ahead can you address the widespread perception report widely television radio and newspaper that you be try somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no be bewildered by it the only reason make no public statement yesterday let say the only reason make no public statement yesterday be that have nothing to add to what be be say and literally do not know until rather late in the day whether anybody be still alive other than those who have be actually see and take to the hospital or take into custody it be purely and simply question of wait for event there be have can not account for why people speculate one way or the other but talk to the attorney general on the day before the action take place talk to she yesterday call she again late last night after she appear on the larry king show and talk to she again this morning president it be not possible for president to distance himself from thing that happen when the federal government be in control will say this however be frankly surprised would be mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatic murder themselves applause regret what happen but it be not possible in this life to control the behavior of other in every circumstance these people kill four federal official in the line of duty they be heavily armed they fire on federal official yesterday repeatedly and they be never fire back on we do everything we could to avoid the loss of life they make the decision to immolate themselves and regret it terribly and feel awful about the child but in the end the last comment have from janet reno be when and talk to she on sunday say now want you you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she say it be because of the child they have evidence that those child be still be abuse and that they be in increasingly unsafe condition and that they do not think it will get any easy with time with the passage of time have to take their word for that so that be where think thing stand can we assume then that you do not think this be mishandle in view of the outcome that you do not run out of patience and if you have it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no well think what you can assume be just exactly what announce today this be the fbi have do lot of thing right for this country over long period of time this be the same fbi that find the people that bomb the world trade center in lickety split record time we want an inquiry should have know be there some other question they should have ask be there some other question should have ask can say for sure that no one that we could have do nothing else to make the outcome come different do not know that that be why want the inquiry and that be why would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non political outside expert who can bring to bear the good evidence we have there be unfortunately rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and want to know whether there be anything we can do particularly when there be child involve but do think it be important to recognize that the wrong doer in this case be the people who kill other and then kill themselves mr president be there any other option present to you for resolve this situation at any point from february until yesterday the president well yes get regular report all along the way there be lot of other option pursue if you go back you all cover it very well the fbi you do very good job of it mean the fbi and the other authority there pursue any number of other option all along the way and lot of they early on seem to be work some of the child get out some of the other people leave there be at one point there seem to be some line of communication open up between koresh and the authority and then he would say thing and not do they and thing just begin to spin downward whether there be other in term of what happen yesterday the conversation have with the attorney general do not involve other option except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we be pursue because they say they want to do this because they think this be the good way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves that be what they think do the government know that the child do not have gas mask congressional hearing once the situation be you in agreement with that the president that be up to the congress they can do whatever they want but think it be very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside expert and as say in my statement if any congressional committee want to look into it we will fully cooperate there be nothing to hide here this be probably the most well cover operation of its kind in the history of the country more more	['talk.politics.guns']

of anti semitism namely that jews can not live with non jews the history and root of the holocaust go back long way while the industru of death and destruction do not operate before its root be firmly place in the century jewish aspiration for emancipation emerge out of the national struggle in europe when the hope for liberation through bourgeois democratic change be dash other alternative for improve the lot of the jews of europe achieve prominence the socialist bund mass movement with enormous following have insignificant opponent the political zionists in outline these two offer diametrically oppose option for jews in europe while the bund be suggest join force with the rest of europe worker the zionists be propose new programme aim at rid europe of its jews by set up some form of jewish state historically nothing be inevitable all depend on the balance of force involve in the struggle history can be see as an option tree every time certain option be choose other route become barred because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice be make be impossible while zionism as an option be take by many young jews it remain minority position until the first day of the reich the zionist federation of germanyvfd an organisation represent tiny minority of german jews be select by the nazis as the body to represent the jews of the reich its be the only flag of an interantional organisation allow to fly in berlin and this be the only international organisation allow to operate during this period from marginal position the leader of the zionist federation be propel to prominence and centrality that surprise even they all of sudden they attain political power power base not on representation but from be select as the choice of the nazi regime for deal with the the jewish problem their position in negotiate with the nazis agreement that affect the life of many ten of thousand of the jews in germany transform they from utopian marginal organisation in germany and some other country in europe into real option to be consider by german jews the good example of this be the transfer agreement of immediately after the nazi takeover in jews all over the world support or be organise world wide boycott of german good this campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authority search frantically for way disable the boycott it be clear that if jews and jewish organisation be to pull out the campaign would collapse this problem be solve by thevfd letter send to the nazi party as early as june outline the degree of agreement that exist between the two organisation on the question of race nation and the nature of the jewish problem and it offer to collaborate with the new regime the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jews abroad against the german development boycott propaganda such as be currently be carry out against germany in many way be in essence unzionist because zionism want not to do battle but to convince and build in their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the zionist organisation manage to undermine the boycott the main public act be the signature of the transfer agreement with the nazi authority during the zionist congress of in essence the agreement be design to get germany jews out of the country and into mandate palestine it provide possibility for jews to take sizeable part of their property out of the country through transfer of german good to palestine this right be deny to jews leave to any other destination the zionist organisation be the act agent through its financial organisation this agreement operate on number of front help jews to leave the country break the ring of the boycott export german good in large quantity to palestine and last but not least enable the regime to be see as humane and reasonable even towards its avow enemy the jews after all they argue the jews do not belong in europe and now the jews come and agree with they after news of the agreement break the boycott be doom if the zionist organization find it possible and necessary to deal with the nazis and import their good who could argue for boycott this be not the first time that the interest of both movement be present to the german public as complementary baron von mildenstein the first head of the jewish department of the ss later follow byichmann be invite to travel to palestine this he do in early in the company of zionist leader kurt tuchler having spend six month in palestine he write series of favourable article in der sturmer describe the new jew of zionism jew nazis could accept and understand this little know episode establish quite clearly the relationship during the early day of nazism between the new regime and thevfd relationship that be echo later in number of key instance even after the nature of the final solution become clear in many case this mean silencing of report about the horror of the extermination book concentrate on this aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust be post ugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust by bethvi in the case of the kastner episode around which jim allen play perdition be base even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of event do not exist it occur near the end of the war the ussr have advance almost up to germany italy and the african basis have be lose the nazis be on the run with number of key country such as rumania leave the axis second front be matter of month away as the western allies prepare their force in the midst of all this we findichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder set up his hz in occupy budapest after the german takeover of the country in april his first act be to have conference with the jewish leadership and to appoint zionist federation member head by kastner as the agent and clearing house for all jews and their relationship with the ss and the nazr authority why they do this be not difficult to see as oppose to poland where its three and half million jews live in ghetto and be visibly different from the rest of the polish population the hungarian jews be an integrate part of the community the middle class be mainly jewish the jews be mainly middle class they enjoy freedom of travel serve in the hungarian fascist army in fronline unit as officer and soldier their name be hungarian how beichmann to find they if they be to be exterminate the task be not easy there be million jews in hungary most of they resident the rest be refugee from other country many have hear about the fate of jews elsewhere and be unlikely to believe any statement by nazi official like elsewhere the only people who have the information and the ear of the frightened jewish population be the judenrat in this case the judenrat comprsie mainly the zionist federation member without their help the ss with officer and less than man plus few hundred hungarian police could not have collect and control million jews when they do not even know their whereabout kastner and the other be leave under no illusionichmann tell joel brand one of the member of kastner committee that he intend to send all hungary jews to auschwitz before he even start the expulsion he tell they clearly that all these jews will die day unless certain condition be meet the committee face simple choice to tell the jews of hungary about their fate with neutral rumania where many could escape be in most case few hour away or to collaborate with the nazis by assist in the concentration process what would not have be believe when come from the ss sound quite plausible when come from the mouth of the zionist leadership thus it be that most of the hungarian jews go quietly to their death assure by their leadership that they be to be send to work camp destruction the train of prominent whichichmann promise to kastner promise he keep to the last detail forichmann it be bargain allow jews to survive as the price pay for the silent collaboration over the death of almost million jews there be no way in which the jews of hungary could even be locate not to say murder without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friend no doubt the ss would hunt few jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have be miniscule compare to the half million who die in auschwitz it be important to realise that kastner be not an aberration like say rumkovsky in lodz kastner act as result of his strongly hold zionist conviction his action be logical outcome of early position this be instance when he expose to the gestapo the existence of british cell of saboteur palgi and senesh and persuade they to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operation at no point during his trial or elsewhere do kastner deny that he know exactly what be to happen to those jews connect to another role they could and should have play that of alarm the whole world to what be happen in europe they have the information but politically it be contrary to their priority the priority be and still be quite simple all that further the zionist enterprise in palestine be follow whatever the price the life of individual jews and non jews be secondary if this process require deal with fascist nazis and other assorted dictatorial regime across the world so

pope have universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decision what prevent from choose any doctrine like and say that papal disagreement be an error that will be resolve in time this be especially true since councils of bishop have basically stand by the pope the ultimate question be the traditional theology of the church this be the only thing that it be possible to resist pope for his departure from the traditional doctrine of the church if command disobey my own view on this be that this conflict could only happen in major way god would never allow hair split situation to develop it would be too complex for people to figure out do not view the present situation in the church as anything extremely complicated run through list of what have happen in the last year in the catholic church and any impartial observer will be aghast it appear that much of what lie at the heart of this matter be disagreement over what be tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline the problem stem from general widespread ignorance of the catholic faith in my opinion most catholics know aboutilch about the catholic faith this leave they wide open for destruction by err bishop it be basically the reformation part ii there be not even question in my mind that in some respect the shard of the catholic church be currently be trample upon by the catholic hierarchy could go on list shocking thing for an hour probably take the situation in campos brazil for example be read book on what happen there after vatican council ii the bishop antonio de castro mayer never introduce all the change that follow in the wake of vatican ii he keep the traditional mass the same old catechism etc he make sure the people know their faith the catholic theology of obedience what modernism be etc he innoculate the people against what be come well one day the order come from rome for his retirement it come when the pope be sick bishop de castro mayer wait until the pope recover then inquire whether this command be what the pope really want or something that some liberal have command in his absence the pope confirm the decision so the good bishop retire the injustice that follow be completely incredible new bishop be instal he proceed to expel most of bishop de castro mayer clergy from their church because they refuse to celebrate the new mass the new bishop would visit parish and celebrate new mass the people would promptly walk out of the church en masse the bishop be enrage by this he usually resort to enlist the help of the secular authority toject the priest from the church the priest would just start build new church the people be completely behind they the old parish have the new mass as the bishop desire and virtually no parishioner the prime motivation for all this be completely illegal accord to canon law no priest can be penalize in any way for say the traditional mass because of legislation enact by pope saint pius nor be there any obligation to say the new mass during all this process the people of campos not just private individual but include civil authority be constantly send petition and letter to rome to do something about the new modernist bishop nothing be ever do no help ever arrive from rome eventually priest be kick out and about people my question to the supporter of sspx be this be there any way that your position with respect to church reform could change and be conform to those of the pope assume that the pope position do not change and that the leader of sspx do not jointly make such choice if not this appear to be claim infallible teaching authority if adopt the view that be not wrong can be wrong and there be no way will change my mind you must change your that have either leave the catholic church or it have leave if the pope define certain thing ex cathedra that would be the end of the controversy that process be all very well understand in catholic theology and anyone who do not go along with it be an instant non catholic the problem here be that people do not appreciate what be go on in the catholic world if they know the faith and what our bishop be do they would be shock we sould argue from now until the second come about what the real traditional teaching of the church be if this be simple matter east and west would not have be separate for over year this be not the case in the catholic church there be massive body of traditional teaching the pope of the last year be especially relevant there be no question at all what the traditional doctrine be think that the teaching magisterieum of the church do not allow error in teaching regard faith and moral even in the short term may be wrong here be not roman catholic that be heresy more or less although they have do great job since the reformation the last year have see so many error spread that it be pitiful infallibility rest in the pope and in the church as whole in the short term pope or large section of the church can go astray in fact that be what usually happen during major heresy large section of the church go astray the pope historically have be much more reliable everything will always come back in the long run what would be the effect of pope make an ex cathedra statement regard the sspx situation would it be honor if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again be not try to be contention be try to understand since be orthodox have get no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other yes it would be honor infallibility be infallibility but what be he go to define that the new mass be well expression of the catholic faith than the old that sex education in the catholic school be wonderful that all religion be wonderful except for that profess by the pope prior to vatican ii it do if the command be legitimate sspx do not view the pope command as legitimate why this be very slippery slope not

where photo radar be in use be limited and some question the legality of such unit good advice learn what photo radar unit look like and keep track of where they be use or else do not speed do radar jammer work be they legal quick answer no and not in the usa detailed answer cheap radar jammer do not work well at all jammer that work be expensive and usually the property of the military jammer be major violation of the regulation of the federal communications commission of the usa drive technique and vehicle dynamics questions what be understeer and oversteer understeer and oversteer be term describe the behaviour of car while corner near the limit limit of adhesion that be most driver do not normally drive hard enough for these term to be descriptive of the situation they encounter simply put they tell whether the car want to go straight in corner steer less or understeer or it want to turn more in corner oversteer understeer be commonly design into most production car so that untrained driver inadvertantly travel too fast will not get into trouble understeer may also be induce by use too much throttle in corner oversteer be design into some more performance orient car it may be induce by lift on the throttle trail throttle oversteer or tto in extreme case lift on the throttle may induce so much oversteer that the car react by fishtailing or spinning some technical detail in corner at speed the tire on the car will develop what be call slip angle the slip angle be the angular difference between the direction that the car be travel and the direction that the steering wheel be direct the car to travel in understeer the front wheel have great slip angle than the rear wheel in oversteer the rear wheel have great slip angle than the front wheel what be rev match downshift when downshifte the engine must be rotate fast in the low gear than it be in the high gear however during downshift normally you declutch and lift your foot from the throttle so the revs drop rather than increase in rev match downshift youlip the throttle before re engage the clutch so that the engine will already be up to the new speed this result in much smooth and fast downshift what do heel and toe mean heel and toe be technique use to do rev match downshift while brake this be normally challenge because you need the right foot for both the brake and throttle it be call heel and toe because you use one end of the foot on the brake and the other on the throttle to match revs for the downshift in many modern car this be misnomer often you must use the ball of the foot on the brake and the right side on the throttle leave foot on the brake and the right foot on the throttle accomplish the same thing what be double clutch downshifting while your right foot be do the above your left foot can do one of three thing nothing declutch once or declutch twice the reason for declutch twice be to match the speed of the two shaft in the transmission to the speed of the engine this be usually couple with rev matching so that while the engine be in neutral and the clutch engage the throttle belip and both shaft of the transmission speed up the procedure be as follow declutch move gearshift lever to neutral engage clutch match revs declutch move gearshift lever to next low gear engage clutch this sound like lot of work but with practice it become natural the problem that double clutch solve be normally the function of the synchronizer within the gearbox in transmission without synchro or with very worn synchro double clutch make it much easy to shift basically if you double clutch well you be not use the synchro at all this be generally unnecessary on street car with synchro in good condition what do the number for acceleration from mile skidpad and slalom time in the auto magazines really mean may they be compare in short not as much as the magazine want you to believe and almost never in more detail the acceleration number mph and mile time in the us may be vaguely compare as long as they all come from the same source testing procedure vary so much from magazine to magazine that compare road track number to car driver number be quite pointless keep in mind too that the same variation apply from driver to driver on the street the driver be major often the major part of the equation skidpad vary and even if they do not skidpad figure be really only test of the stickiness of the stock tire they change radically when tire compound change do not make any assumption about the comparative handling of say two sport sedan base on skidpad number this be not to suggest that skidpad be without value however skidpad be an excellent educational tool at drive school they be simply of limited value in the comparison of anything except tire slalom time be slightly more useful they test some small part of the automobile transient response however they be also heavily influence by the stock rubber on the car and they do not test many corner of the car envelope they do not tell you all you need to know before make buying decision for example they do not tell you what the rear end of the car will do on road which suddenly go off camber when car have an adjustable suspension these test be usually do in the sport setting which may be quite unsuitable for daily driving the list of caveat could go on for page after page my buddy claim that wide tire do not make any difference accord or corner at more than do he know what he be talk about in short he have not get clue in more detail the equation for friction use in freshman physics textbook presume that the surface be smooth dry and non deformable none of which properly apply to tire traction except in the case of stone cold tire on dry pavement which be far below its proper operating temperature pavement be never smooth it be always irregular to great or less extent tire which be not really dry and solid as rubber be substance which in its natural form be liquid and which have only be coerce into semblance of solidity by chemical magic deform to match the surface of the pavement which vehicle be travel over in tire at operate temperature grip be actually generate by shear stress inside the deform rubber and not by anything even remotely resemble friction in the freshman physics sense of the term the colder tire be relative to its operate temperature the close its behaviour will be to the traditional concept of friction if much hot than the its proper operating temperature the more likely the possibility of some part of the tire actually revert to liquid which be mostly like this latter though be almost completely unlikely to happen in normal street driving so unless you be competition driver or do lot of high speed track driving do not worry about it because tire traction be completely out of the domain of simple friction it do not obey the freshman physics equation at all thus dragster accelerate at more than and race car corner and brake at more than because simple friction do not apply it be actually possible for different sized contact patch to generate differ amount of grip an actual analysis of tire behavior would require technique such as finite element analysis due to the complexity of the mechanism misc question what do name or acronym stand for here be list of some of the name which be commonly ask about be careful in solicit the meaning of other name as misinformation abound on the net in particular never ask in rec humor if you want useful result saab svenska aeroplan or the

public by baruch me iri all those involve in this matter politely refuse my request one way or another look the subject be too delicate if comment on it will be implicitly admit that it be true if mention specific case even hint at it might be guilty of make public something which may legally not be publish the state of israel have never officially admit that for many year there have be in its prison israeli citizen who be sentence to long prison term without either the fact of their arrest or the crime of which they be accuse ever be make public more precisely court order publication ban be place on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment in israel of citizen be imprison without we the citizen of this country know anything about it not know anything about the fact that one person or another be try and throw in prison for security offense in complete secrecy in the distant past for example during the day of the lavon ya affair we hear about the third man be in prison but many year have pass since then and what exist then can today no long be find even in south american country or in the former communist country but it appear that this be still possible in israel of the chair of the knesset committee on law the constitution and justice mk david zucker send letter on this subject early this week to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor ma ariv have obtain the content of the letter during the past several year number of israeli citizen have be imprison for various period for security offense in some of these case legal publication ban be impose not only on the specific of the crime for which the prisoner be convict but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment in those case after be legally convict the prisoner spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner assert mk zucker on the other hand zucker agree in his letter that there be absolutely no question that it be possible and in some case it be imperative that publication ban be impose on the specific of security offense and the course of trial but even in such case the court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstance under which trial will not be hold in public however one must ask whether the imposition of publication ban on the mere fact of person arrest and on the name of person sentence to prison be justify and appropriate in the state of israel the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know be not consistent with the disappearance of person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison zucker thus decide to turn to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question the state of israel be strong enough to withstand the cost incur by abide by the principle of public punishment the state of israel can not be allow to have prisoner whose detention and its cause be keep secret write zucker the legal counsel of the civil rights union attorney mordechai shiffman say that we as the civil rights union do not know of any case of security prisoner citizens of israel who be imprison and whose imprisonment can not be make public this be situation which if it actually exist be definitely unhealthy just like censorship be an unhealthy matter the union be aware say shiffman of case where notification of suspect arrest to family member and lawyer be withhold be speak only of several day know also of case where detainee be not allow to meet with an attorney sometimes for the whole first month of arrest that be do because of the great secrecy the suspect himself his family his lawyer or even journalist can challenge the publication ban in court but there be case where the family member themselves be not interested in publicity the journalist know nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone be happy attorney yossi arnon an official of the bar claim that give the law as they exist in israel today situation where the arrest of person for security offense be keep secret be definitely possible nothing be easy the court order publication ban and that be that someone who have commit security offense can spend long year in prison without we know anything about it do you find this situation acceptable attorney arnon definitely not we live in democratic country and such state of affair be impermissible be well aware that publication can be damaging from the standpoint of security but total non publication silence be unacceptable consider the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in his case we know that he be charge with aggravate espionage and sentence to year in prison the trial be hold behind closed door nobody know the detail except for those who be authorize to it be somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reason but as have note we at least be aware of his imprisonment why be the matter actually that serious can not we trust the discretion of the court attorney arnon the judge have no choice but to trust the presentation make to they the judge do not have the tool to investigate this give the government enormous power power which they can misuse and what if there really be security issue attorney arnon be man of the legal system not security expert democracy stand in opposition to security believe it be possible enter into detail we have already see how the law concern publication ban can be misuse in the case of the rachel heller murder suspect in the murder be hold for many month without the matter be make public attorney shiffman on the other hand believe that state security can be legitimate reason for prohibit publication of suspect arrest or of convict criminal imprisonment healthy situation definitely not but be aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security different opinion be express by attorney uri shtendal former advisor for arab affair to prime ministers levi eshkol and golda meir clearly we be speak of isolated special case such situation contrast with the principle that judicial proceeding must be hold in public no doubt this contradict the principle of freedom of expression definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which be also harm by the prohibition of publication nevertheless add shtendal the legislator allow for the possibility of such ban to accommodate special case where the damage possible as consequence of publication be great than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principle have mention the authority to decide such matter of publication do not rest with the prime minister or the security service but with the court which we may rest assure will authorize publication ban only if it have be convince of its need beyond shadow of doubt nevertheless attorney shtendal agree as rule clearly such phenomenon be undesirable such an extreme step must be take only in the most extreme

know maybe they be wait for people to bring they the goner and the seriously injure to treat they there in the police precinct do not know what they be there for there be also doctor from baku there they examineyuda and and say these woman need to go to the maternity home but we do not know what to do with the rest so they take we and lose contact with my parent my boss everyone my boss say do not worry will find you no matter where you be no matter what happen we go to the hospital there we be examine by department head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva think her name be she examine we the ambulance be from baku figure out that the sumgait ambulance have not do anything they do not respond to any call people call and neither the police nor the ambulance show any sign of life that doctor look over and could tell from her behavior that something very good have happen for she become quite glad even think to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad be wrong she look over and say now why be you suffer so you do not know what your people have be do your people do even bad thing and think great have to deal with she and feel so bad think why do not just die so as not to have to hear more stuff like this from people like she here be in this condition and be tell about something that our people do just do not have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours have not already do stay there then they bring in another woman ira she be marry and she be rape in her own apartment too there be three of we irayuda and the next morning they takeyuda and ira away they do not do anything to help we this be in the old maternity home in the combine block they do not do anything more than examine that be it do not want any shot or tranquilizer nothing what shot could have calm down do not even want to look at they lie in the ward either it just work out that way or they do it on pur pose but be alone be alone even though the ward be pack that same evening woman come by and ask what be wrong with that my face be disfigure she ask what have happen to and say well to ask your brother what happen there be no point in ask your brother can well explain what happen she fall into faint all the doctor throw themselves at she and the doctor categorically forbid anyone to come into my ward then people from work come to see my boss his daughter they bring clothing because be literally naked the only thing have on be dress but the woman who give it to be very short and the dress be way up above my knee and the woman orderly say can not believe you put on such short dress who be you show off your leg to here go back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something people from work come and bring something in sack apple think three or four pound but could not take they have become so weak that it be just embarrassing say that could not take the apple and really do not have any appetite no one have to bring anything some woman take the sack and oh yes then hear that the head doctor tell nurse that my medical history should be hide or tear up completely so that no one would know that be an armenian maybe they would not figure it out from look at so they must have be think that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be bad or perhaps someone be outside on the street do not know in any case do not sleep wink that night the next morning they pick up whole police detail put in bus and off we go do not even know where they be take they take to the club where the troop be the very one be in that ill fate evening get off the bus near the city party committee there be great many troop tank armored personnel carrier the whole scene be terrible see few people know there and that calm little have already think that be the only one leave so there be five or six of we leave in sumgait after that night still do not know what happen to my parent they do not come to see in the hospital and my boss tell that everything be fine do not know whether to believe he or not maybe he be just try to calm down maybe something happen on the way then go to the club and see lot of people know they all know one another they be all kiss each other and ask what happen what go on two day later they come to see from work they be there all the time each day they come show interest and be constantly bring money they do everything they could of course be most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleague who do not lose his presence of mind and who do not change his opinion neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happen he constantly take an interest sincere interest from the heart then about two day later the secretary of the party committee come not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours be part of comrade kerimov very important figure in our town he make arrangement with the emergency medical personnel to take away because if sit down by myself could not get up or lie down again there be something wrong with my lung it be hard to breathe they examine there several time there lie be several doctor they all think that that it must just be when be in the maternity home even ask make it point of insist that they take to the trauma section because feel so awful there be no way something inside be not break my rib well they take there and take ray and say that everything be fine there be emergency medical worker on duty in the club the mother of one of marina friend be there she be the head doctor at the sumgait children clinic they have every kind of antifever agent in the world which be exactly what need at that moment think say that be have great difficulty breathing could not seem to get enough air something be wrong with they put tight bandage around my chest and waist later overhear some people say that have be cut all over think they just see be all bandage up and decide that my breast and face have be cut but be not cut they take we to thehimik boarding house we live there long time soon appear representative they be agitate at first people would not talk to they and drive they off one of the armenian woman shout we demand that seidov come the response be it be seidov who send we seidov be the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers the woman say we will only see seidov daughter have she come here we will do the same thing to she that they do to our daughter and then we will deal with you agitator and so on more of they say have seidov himself come this go on day in day out the agitator keep come and come this drive we out of our wit then people gradually start depart for yerevan because they realize it be senseless to stay everything get on our nerve the smell the small child there be child at the sk club child who have literally just come out of the maternity home what be they do in club that do not even have run water all the time at first we have to pay someone tell we that they would bring we food for free the child be ill everything stank there well imagine about people in small movie theater with seating for no more than you could not sit or lie down it be impossible to even move the stench be awful even the small infant take ill overnight there hear that they be arrive seriously ill in yerevan the infant they have to be wash they have to be bathe not to mention that we the adult be ill and need care people be faint right and leave just do not know everyone be cry everyone only the young people the man somehow manage to keep it together but the woman be in constant state of panic it seem to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seem clear that we have be gather together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there would not be single armenian left then people go up to the attic do not see they only hear they because be lie down and could not get up lay right on the stage we have some room there apparently they catch two people with either oil or gas think they want to burn the theater maybe someone see they do not be in no condition to open my eye everyone be suspicious of everyone else they would ask be not you an azerbaijani think see you somewhere think you be an azerbaijani they lead out all the man and start let they back in by check their passport relative might be cover for each other half of the people do not have any document there be people who have run out of their home in nothing but pair of pant and slipper or wear just shirt not like they should have with their id so on the on sunday think the police do nothing to help we on monday everything resume where it have leave off on block they do not spare soul there not child not pregnant woman nobody they kill they burn they hack with axis just everything possible they murder the melkumian family whom know my mother work with they their daughter in law go to school with my old sister they be brutally murder only the two daughter in law survive by miracle one be able to save herself she run away the neighbor would not take she in so she run about the building until she find refuge she be pregnant and have two small child this all continue on monday in block on the when the troop be already in the city they murder people they overturn automobile and they burn entire family they say they do not even know for sure if the people be armenians or not hear that the lezgins suffer too be not sure myself do not see any lezgin who have be injure they burn car so it be very difficult now to say exactly who die and who do not it be very difficult to identify the corpse or rather what remain of the corpse after they be douse in gasoline and burn it be all very hard to imagine of course hear that many people disappear without trace from the btz plant two people include woman who work the night shift aunt razmella who also live in microdistrict they be stop bus between baku and sumgait in the evening people who have be visit baku be return to sumgait and people from baku be go home from sumgait and there be student too they be simply savagely murder they be stop the bus the driver immediately do what they be tell because there be just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people they stop the bus drag the armenians out and kill they on the spot do not see it myself but hear that they put they all in pile so as to burn they later it be hard to discern from the corpse well you can not call they corpse you have to figure out from the ashe who it be hear that two fellow save two woman one student ira if be not mistaken she be in the hospital long time after that and she still can not figure out who save she she be also brutally rape and beat and throw onto pile of corpse the fellow pull she out of that whole pile of corpse put his coat on she take she into his arm and carry she to the city still can not imagine how he manage to do that hear that from engels grigorian he know she apparently well lot of people go to that hospital anyway she be in the hospital and singe song in armenian and they write the word down and think he still have that piece of paper because he say that lot of people now have that song the one she sing in the hospital where she lie in such bad shape they could not find the guy who save she he leave she in someone apartment and call the ambulance she be in such awful shape that probably like she could not remember anyone face think that know one of the people who break into our house maybe have talk with he once but receive so many blow everything be just knock out of my head can not remember to this day who he be then it seem see the secretary of the directorate party organization where marina work she go to school and work she go to night school at azi and work by day at thehimzashchita construction and installation administration be the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often meet with the secretary of party and komsomol organization we have joint meeting know they all have even talk with they and he know be from armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it become obvious that many of those people be azerbaijanis bear in armenia they take to various police station to the police precinct and to the procuracy because the ussr procuracy get involve in the case and iden tifie the photograph of people who could more or less recognize they show the people who be in our apartment they be work on our case but can not even recognize they although it be prove that they be the one they be process it somehow they tell that they know that someone hold by the arm and someone else hold by the leg when they be drag there be someone else in our apartment who do not even touch he just steal blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of they as much as have hear about they and see they they be all from kafan the secretary of the party organization be name najaf najafzayev he be there when everything start it must have be he because do not recognize anyone else in the crowd whom know besides he all the more since tell he listen you do something because you know he turn away and go toward the bedroom where marina be well you could not see marina anyway there be such noisy confusion of people that you could not make out anyone all of it fly right out of my head and then gradually become myself again at the city party committee there be military people there tell they what go on and they write it all down tell they his name on march the secretary of our first trust party organization the one we be part of come to see we his name be najafzayev tell mamma if he be here despite the fact that give his name it mean that either his alibi have be confirm or probably that they think be crazy not responsible for my word he say what do they do to you how awful myself hide an armenian family then after some time go by he come back again and say something entirely different be not at home my family and go to baku say marina what be he say he say something totally different before after that do not go to see our procurator our case be be handle by procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov tell thatzayev case have just get to he and there be so name involve what be they do withzayev do he prove his alibi or not they just think that since be hit in the head can not say anything for sure whether it be he or not it will be an insult if he be in our apartment and do not have to pay for it but at the same time be afraid to say be hundred percent sure that it be he because no mat ter who name they tell no you be wrong he do not do that that one be not there all the face have get mixed up in my mind who do what exactly can not say when they take outside there be whole crowd there but do not see it because have my eye

thing seem evident to thing which this clinton clipper do not address the all pertain to opportunite for abuse and conclusion base on what have see the membership of this group except for two notable person agree to if anything bad be possible by the government in theory it almost always end up happen in fact so the key be to make abuse impossible question authority and remember power do corrupt think one have to regard this whole idea in the sense that it will be expand to include other datum form such as data transfer and store datum and as such should be treat as if it be expand or such expansion will be almost impossible to stop use clipper as precident there be hint of that in the proposal remember that say please bear with be not very articulate so take more word to say what other could say much more briefly thank you as suggest this be now the hint be in the proposal that this or similar proposal be be consider for other form of encryption such as datum transfer datum file and such largely dependent on how this thing be accept or fly think one would be wise to treat this in the manner one would when not if it get expand to other area than cellular phone think this be guarantee to happen if this proposal get by salami politic it have be and be use in several other area it be certain to be use here government be not go to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop whenever they want to court order require have prove to be rather flimsy guarantee if the case warrant they can always sieze the material and force one to give the key or sit in jail forever on periodically renew contempt charge so it be not deny the justice system the information nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty or refuse to divulge the mean to access the info this be not protect under the fifth one can be force to perform acts that would result in divulge incriminate evidence so block restriction on private encryption be not prevent legitimate law enforcement it do make illegitimate law enforcement bunch more difficult especially fishing expedition without the target knowlege do not give up the right to be safe from that that should be non negotiable and clinton and co know it which be probably why they quietly develop this thing figure if they get it this far they can ram it on through how come those consult could be roughly describe as we insider they can not quietely impliment it though when they ban other scheme to ensure its exclusive use hence the nice pr document to try and reassure everyone do not buy into it have government really earn that kind of trust past or future to be secure and free one must keep government honest and the only way to do that be to make abuse impossible not unlikely or difficult so what one could use information gain by re use of the key save after the last case be finish or other mean master key backdoor easily break algorithm to find other evidence which give to judge would authorize tap which would not have be possible otherwise this have be the more common manner of abuse of wiretap in the past for local cop this might be workable to keep they honest but the feds have workaround somehow bet on it do anyone really believe for example that the government will use scheme nsa can not listen in on scan for keyword either easily defeat in realtime or via master key sure do not this whole thing sound like something to eliminate the need to use old fashioned police work to build case in the past eavesdropping be rather easy with or without court order think the law enforcement community have become bit spoiled and will resist change that require they to revert to use old fashioned detective work just find it somewhat surprising come from bunch that care so much about civil and individual right that put people first the question be put people first to where with the innard not be reveal how be one to be sure there doesn exist master key for use by nsa etc so they can do their keyword scan etc on conversation they routinely monitor without specific court order remember the cellular phone limitiation be only temporary bet on it and so far have not hear about police tell people that they have be tap and nothing incriminate be find what be to keep they from simply keep the key on file for next time after awhile they would have quite collection keep especially for folk they deem disruptive and if they get only one key that would reduce the search space lot unless it be an rsa scheme remember nixon year need for court order really slow they down do not it and unless the escrow account be not government control fat chance see one end up be under say treasury the other under justice competitor clinton clipper or descendent when this idea be expand one the key or the innard for this algorithm perhaps not an important concern but give past government behavior and the other problem what will one do when it be expand to data storage encryption you can bet that if clipper be accept that will be next on the agenda it be even hint at in the proposal read it carefully expect the argumet well if you get nothing to hide fine then use that argument one should not object to video camera be instal in every room of one home grant an exteme expansion of the idea but the principle hold private stuff should remain private even from govt fishing expedition and law rule may change in the future as pretty meaningless if they want to do get something do not work so hard to give up some rather treasured right or establish bad precident please the price could be hell to pay later people would fight law forbid more now but in say two year because we have this crisis situation which must be address by some drastic action just this add reasonable restriction will only bother those who have somete to hide etc please do not buy into it if the clinton clipper be so very good why not make its algrithm public so many people can exchange idea and examine it rather than few isolate respected expert respect by whom for what perhaps certain professor who like key bank would be one of the select expert this do seem to expand on some idea the person be advocate if recall how would anybody know that what the expert examine be the same as what will end up be use in the clipper chip if it be keep secret perhaps the clipper will use crippled version with master key provision or feature not present in the version subject for study and evaluation by the expert and who choose the experte the government no conflict of interest there and be not it requirement for any decent encryption scheme that it not have its effectiveness reduce by have the algrorithm widely know be lead to believe that one should assume the other side have everything you have except for the key recall idea present to this group be reject if requirement exist the algorithm be secret another question since it be safe bet this clipper thing would not be use for government security they be regard it as not real secure but good enough for common folk think would like to see full description not pr non statement of just what good enough mean think when say how strong it be good enough really mean not very the excuse that other country have these restriction be not acceptable other country do not have our bill of rights and constitution which the people not the government of those other country often regard with envy what we have as right they have as revokable privilege and if we expect to retain those right and protection we must not allow

original and show initiative mort sahl on the tom snyder radio show abc radio network october nlns believe it or not be plan this comparative review of mein kampf and limbaugh transcribed rant the way thing ought to be before sahl issue his comparative review as usual sahl be independent and sharp as scalpel my effort can only dream of compare favorably to mort at least it have fairly popular orginating premise everyone would mention the idea to think it be either divinely inspire or at least past due for delivery those reaction be base on parallel that should be obvious to the most peripheral observer of the act of those false prophet both be note for their galvanize oratorical skill which they both use with passion to generate political cult of massive numerical proportion in fact limbaugh claim to have an audience of just over million almost identical to the number of vote cast for hitler in the april german election both use myopic social perspective to build the cult and enthusiastically amputate fact from the record to fabricate their ideological quilt the last point be glaringly document by passage in the opening page of both book hitler example be when on page he claim the german nationalist terrorist leo schlageter he bomb part of railway line between dusseldorf and duisburg be catch in the act in be betray to france by representative of his government when there have never be any factual foundation for such statement in fact the government of both the reich and prussia as well as the vatican actively intervene to save he from execution and almost succeed limbaugh follow suit by make the hysterically sarcastic claim in his introduction that in school or during commencement ceremony or many other public place god be unconstitutional of course it be not god but the official imposition of particular concept of god against an individual will that be unconstitutional but limbaugh be too gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that of course one would assume that by compare the two book my main point would be that the way thing ought to be be the modern american mein kampf not really at the time of the first german version of mein kampf hitler be just four month out of prison june and try to reorganize the nazis he use the book to build his dozen million follower limbaugh on the other hand come up with his book after build his dozen million twelve million go long way in weimar germany that it do in the republicrat united states thus the more accurate parallel would be that limbaugh daily three hour radio show be the american mein kampf the primary propoganda tool use to pump up the angry volume and that the way thing ought to be be actually the american triumph of the will translation of the same fascist message into different medium also the print word be the more important medium in weimar germany since radio be still be think of by impoverished germans as medium of luxury in today on the other hand americans be more likely to spend few second to tune radio dial at no monetary charge than drop for page of transcript of the same word but as mort sahl also observe on the radio the other night some cloutmeister of the radical right want limbaugh to be focal point of their propoganda and remember sahl be an al haig conservative these day mort might not know exactly who rush equivalent of rodolf hess be the book itself suggest ed mclaughlin the former president of abc radio and now limbaugh partner infm media the radio program production company but mort himself be veteran of the talk show having host they in new york washington and los angeles he know what evil lurk in the heart of major market medium man he know that limbaugh could not have collect his audience have not the opportunity be place on silver platter and hand to he limbaugh earn his money just as honestly as al capone do it be almost worthy of rico indictment on question of social issue there be an overabundance of material in the limbaugh book that seem to echo hitler venom for example on their own qualifications to control society hitler out of the host of sometimes million of people who individually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth partly perhaps understand it one man author emphasis must step forward in order to form with apodeictic force out of the waver world of

dying off or his decline would again lower upon this earth the dark veil of time without culture he who dare to lay hand upon the high image of the lord sin against the benevolent creator of this

should do whatever we can to win people to the lord if for no other reason to keep they from go jesus in mt tell we that he do not prepare hell for people he prepare it for the devil and his angel no where in the bible do read anywhere that god predestine anybody to go to hell moody use to say that the elect be the whosoever will and the nonelect be the whosoever will not whether or not that be theologically sound could not defend but its practical jesus say to the people of israel ye would not now some of you may not be student of the bible heck some of you may not be christians have you ever say to somebody do not believe in hell believe in the religion of jesus but do you know that jesus talk more about hell than he do about heaven oh believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount you find hell teach by jesus in the sermon on the mount you will read that jesus talk about the tree be cast into the fire several time he talk about hell and about judgment in fact over and over in the synoptic matthew mark and luke jesus talk about hell not isaiah not moses not john the baptist though he do but jesus the son of god the great beloved one preach about hell because he love people and do not want to see they go there now if there be no hell then jesus preach in vain it be our lord jesus not some angry baptist preacher that say where the worm never die and where the fire never go out jesus say that it be jesus who call hell furnace of fire it be jesus that use the word condemnation and this be the condemnation that man love darkness rather than light because their deed be evil jesus say that how can we get it across to you that loving die jesus preach about hell not only that but he go through hell that be what calgary be all about when my lord be on the cross darkness fall he call hell outer darkness do you have this idea that hell be place where the gambler be gamble over here the drunk be get drunk over there and the prostitute be prostitute their body over there that be not what hell be hell be not party there be no fellowship there he call it outer darkness outer away from god darkness god be light no when he be on the cross he be make sin for you and for god treat jesus the way sinner have to be treat that be be sobering thought as my son would say an awesome thought my god my god why hast thou forsake hell be isolation there be no fellowship in hell there be no friendship in hell there be no loving embrace in hell there be no hand shake in hell there be no word of encouragement in hell thirst it go much deep than physical thirst hell be eternal craving with no satisfaction the man whose life be live for drug will crave it eternally the man whose life be live for the lust of woman body will crave it eternally and not be satisfied one theologian have put it this way and think it deserve merit what be hell hell be just the kind of environment that match the internal condition of the lose in recent post be try to remember the founder of the word of life ministry have remember his name jack wertzen and find that the illustration that give be not his his illustration be that he be talk and he be comment about it to jack they sing these song and read bible verse and their praise this and that can not stand it jack do you think god would send to hell jack answer by say yes think he would of course the barber say what do you mean by that well if you can not stand live at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymn and praise to god now what would you do in heaven where they will do it for eternity you would be miserable because god love you he would put you where it would match what you really be it make man think the crucifixion of jesus christ be fact that necessitate the eternal existence of hell because on the cross he perform an eternal act do not ask how do not know but he be god and he be the infinite eternal and when he die he die an infinite eternal death it be by that eternal act that he purchase eternal life for the whosoever will he suffer eternal judgment lot of people would like to detour around hell by say everybody be go they the sheep from the goat after you die there be probationary period in which god prepare you for heaven no my bible say that it be appoint unto man once to die and then come judgment some of the cultist believe in annihilation after you die sssswish just like mosquito you be squish out no in rev we be tell that their be eternal existence in hell just as there be in heaven do not enjoy make these kind of statement and maybe you do not enjoy listen to they but we have to preach the entire word of god there be place call hell if could give one verse of scripture that could give any hope that people be not go there would give it to you but have not find it that fact that there be place call hell the fact that our god be god of holiness and must judge sin the fact that he have make we the kind of creature we be and therefore we be responsible the fact that he have place we in uni verse that have purpose and design behind it the fact that sin be such an awful thing and the fact that god himself go through hell to save we as have already mention if you be christian you must worn other its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell they that just around the bend the bridge be out know therefore the terror of lord we persuade man if you have not accept jesus be your savior you be take an awful chance as say to the jehovah witnesses who no long frequent my door if you be right and be wrong then will have live good life and will die and cease to exist but if be right and you be wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation do not mean to make fun at this point but its like dirty harry say you have get to ask yourself do feel lucky well do you man get to know his limitation do not be one of the whosoever will not be because while be yet sinner he die for there be no great love than this that man lie down his life

combinedtm	100	71	man israel god jesus weep good use betray moses behold	11093	-	biblical contradictions answered judas post this several day ago for dave butler he may have miss it my usenet board have change little just in case he miss it here it be again dave butler write subject re new biblical contradiction fallaciously answered judas can basically restrict this post to show the type of evidence mr decenso have present and answer his two question and couple of his spurious insult and false claim my reply db by the way mr decenso you really should have look in the index of your bauer arndt gingrich greek lexicon you would have find that the word in act for lot belero not chorion as state by mr archer and nowhere in the very large discussion oflero in do the to theological dictionary of the new testament by bromley be the meaning burial plot discuss it discuss the form oflerogleroleroo etc and the various meaning oflerog plot of land and inheritance but mention nothing about chorion or burial plot why do this not surprise thus it would seem to be very good thing you dump archer as reference db later correct himself subject re new biblical contradiction fallaciously answered judas owe the group an apology it be my habit to check my article before and after their submission for error in my last article state be wrong admit that do not have handle on greek grammar and thus confusedlero the second to last word in act as be the plot of land discuss in actuality it be chorion which be the last word act unfortunately my greek dictionary do not discuss chorion so can not report as to the nuance of the word do not know if someone else would have catch this though be sure that someone would be able to do so but have an aversion to disseminate mistake especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove point my reply vary noble of you dave do not want to have to go to number of source to show you wrong although be research chorion little db of course the only other reference mr decenso have give be bullinger and bullinger use such ridiculous exegisis that when accuse mr decenso of actually believe bullinger he reply that misquote he of my response to see what really say in my posting of this article actually mr decenso you say that there be benefit to our argument in that it cause to to rediscover bullinger exegisis do not realize that you would find such garbage beneficial unless you be convince by it my reply thank you for correct your restating of my point db and mr decenso also reply thus apologize for think that even mr decenso could find such drek convincing he should specify which part of bullinger he find convincing and quit hiding behind disingenuous mask of this be what bullinger believe not necessarily what believe so which be it mr decenso do you find the exegisis convincing or not my reply one of my purpose in debate these allege contradiction with you and other be to diseminate many different view of possible reconciliation raise by various bible scholar and student alike when present my views will clearly distinguish they from now on db of course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso have present no greek exegisis at all and mr decenso have make big thing about my not refer back to the actual greek thus we find this demand on his part for quality greek exegisis to beypocritical requirement my reply good point but in your declare that these passage be contradictory you have produce only superficial reasoning and observation nor have you dig deeply be glad you have begin in this post will begin greek study on these passage in more depth than think necessary as well db it would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso have actually use as evidence now we know what he claim for standard as he have state it often enough but be these actual standard he have use or simply empty hyperbole let us see he have use and since he be try to reconcile it to other passage we see that he have also use on the other hand he have present no use of historical context or historical content or other pertinent historical info or cultural context or cultural content or other pertinent cultural info or grammatical construction or even hebrew and greek word study remember archer and bullinger do not count thus we find his vaunted criterion for exegisis be just empty mouthing my reply question do you find such criterion important if so do you plan on start shallow observation do not mean this in bad way at this point in our debate have not find it necessary to present total exegetical analysis of these passage since we seem to keep beat around the bush and not get into the core of the verse do not believe it necessary to use many of the above criterion to refute your argument re judas in acts and matthew but will do my good from this point on to use several of the above criterion since you desire to hope you will also it will greatly enhance our study of these passage db the only thing he have actually use beyond the passage itself be any other passage thus mr decenso should be honest and note that most of his list be red herring and his only real criterion seem to be my reply the reason be simple you be mistate the passage you claim that the passages contradict one another do not see the passages contradict one another they may very well be complimentary as many scholarly source mention matthew may not be present judas death as you claim but we will look at your defense of this later also the reward of iniquity in the acts passage may not be the piece of silver in matthew passages although you have valiant attempt later at state why you believe it be at this beginning stage in our debate we be lay some scriptural groundwork which will be expand upon through deep exegesis db of course the only reason can see to so drastically reinterpret passage as he have do with judas death be to make it agree with another passage so that both could be consider correct my reply one of the reason have give different exegetical view of the passage be that you seem to think the majority of scholarship be wrong in conclude these passage be complimentary however see no problem in tony rose explanation of judas death how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hang himself in matthew and fall headlong he burst open this question of the manner in which judas die be one with which we be constantly confront in our travel many people point to the apparent discrepancy in the two account as an obvious irreconcilable error some have go so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant bible be destroy by these contradictory account however this be not the case at all matthew relate that judas hang himself while peter tell we he fall and be crush by the impact the two statement be indeed different but do they necessarily contradict each other matthew do not say that judas do not fall neither do peter say that judas do not hang himself this be not matter of one person call something black and the other person call it white both account can be true and supplementary possible reconstruction would be this judas hang himself on tree on the edge of precipice that overlook the valley of hinnom after he hang there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope give way and judas fall down the ledge mangle his body in the process the fall could have be before or after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility be entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom be examine from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terrace to foot in height and almost perpendicular there be still tree around the ledge and rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it be easy to conclude that judas strike one of the jagged rock on this way down tear his body open it be important to remember that we be not tell how long judas remained hang from the tree or how advanced be the decomposition of his body before his fall louis gaussen relate story of man who be determined to kill himself this individual place himself on the sill of high window and point pistol at his head he then pull the trigger and leap from the window at the same time on the other hand person could say that this man take his life by shoot himself while another could rightly contend he commit suicide by jump form the tall building in this case both be true as both be true in the case of matthew and peter account of the death of judas it be merely situation of different perspective of the same event your only reason for reject this be believe your attempt to discredit inerrancy you have not relate how this be impossible or highly unlikely here be what you say in an early post db quote tony rose the add text in this version be so heavy that assume you be truly so opposed to such tactic you should find it not credible but you seem to find tony roseisegesis satisfactory while clearly reject david joslin here you discredit tony explanation base on what you deem too heavy for the passage but you have not address why you feel that way you can say it be vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction but that do not tell it do not happen nor have you show why you reject that possibility question be matthew lie or be luke lie or be they both lie or be either or both of they misinformed why do you think there be such an alleged contradiction do not think you have ever tell we what you believe in this respect db at present though mr decenso only ask two question of actually find question to be rather stupid request but will answer it because he now restrict himself to two point first would point out that hang be very efficient manner for end life in fact it be bit of fluke when someone survive hang except in fantasy cowboy movie and even then it usually refer to as an attempt hanging my reply work at an agency that investigate child abuse and neglect today get call re child that attempt suicide by hang himself because his mother be on crack he fail in his attempt and be in child psych ward at local hospital hang attempt be not always successful beg the question if may quote you last night listen to the bible answer man broadcast the christian research institute show one of the scholar on there use several of these term that you use be not all that familiar with they the man on the bam show teach comparative religion and logic it be interesting db this be so prevalent that so that to say man hang himself with no other qualifier be synonymous with state that he kill himself my reply qualifier be important at time as we will see in an ot passage will mention below do hanging always have this outcome do matthew who be the only source we have re judas hang himself state that judas die as result to say it be synonymous mean it have the same meaning as boy age hang himself but he live this be only one of probably thousand of document case we can discover db now be not alone in this thought in fact since mr decenso so respect christian scholarly include greek scholar opinion do some research my reply thank you dave db interestingly not one of the christian reference read interpret the hanging as be anything but fatal suicide my reply above mine so it be ok to use christian source to back your point what about tony position do you value it or even consider it as valid possibility also be it possible that the source you read may be wrong or lying or deceive in other part of their book if so should we do as we have do with archer toss they to the side and not value anything they say include their interpretation of the hanging of judas be sure you would find some error and maybe even some deception in those source you also note they interpret the hanging as mean he die although that be very possibly true do you find that in the text itself remember that be the first criterion we must examine db this include the biblical knowledge commentary by woodward and zuck my reply which own it be good source of commentary info but not inerrant db the interpreters on volume commentary on the bible by laydon the one volume bible commentary by dunelow word meaning of the testament ralph earl the abingdon bible commentary publish by abingdon harpers bible commentary by william neal actually could have present many more as well my reply appreciate your do this research dave maybe we be get somewhere in how we both should approach these allege contradiction more in depth study db in each case these reference specifically describe that the interpretation of matt as successful suicide and thus can only conclude that the greek word apagchw ie hang oneself be translate as successful hanging my reply above mine no you can not only conclude this although as tony say this be highly probable outcome but matthew do not state death as be result the greek word be apagcho matthew be it be only occurrence in the new testament in the septuagint the greek translation of the ot use at the time of jesus it be only use in samuel now when ahithophel see that his advice be not follow he saddle donkey and arise and go home to his house to his city then he put his household in order and hang himself and die and he be bury in his father tomb notice that not only be it state that ahithophel hang himself gr sept apagcho but it explicitly add and die here we have no doubt of the result in matthew we be not explicitly tell judas die also there be nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure it simply mean hang oneself db but mr decenso you be more than welcome to disagree and show more reputable christian scholar that insist that the hanging be not successful my reply above mine reputable you mean one that have never err as far as insist that the hanging be unsuccessful that can not be do even by as say in an early post although still agree with tony exegesis as be the most probable explanation regard judas death take into account several criterion have recently notice some new thing in matthew mat then he throw down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself but the chief priest take the silver piece and say it be not lawful to put they into the treasury because they be the price of blood and they consult together and buy with they the potter field to bury stranger in therefore that field have be call the field of blood to this day first of all notice that the text do not say that judas die as result of hang all it say be that he go and hang himself luke however in acts tell we that and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrail gush out this be pretty clear indication along with the other detail give in acts peter speech the need to pick new apostle etc that at least after judas fall he be dead so the whole concept that matthew and luke both recount judas death be highly probable but not clear cut also write my reply here we have stickler dave that have to say just recently notice let us look at the passage in matthew mat say have sin by betray innocent blood and they say what be that to we you see to it mat then he throw down the piece of silver in the temple and depart and go and hang himself mat but the chief priest take the silver piece and say it be not lawful to put they into the treasury because they be the price of blood mat and they consult together and buy with they the potter field mat therefore that field have be call the field of blood to this day notice verse then he go and hang himself matthew do not say judas die do it should we assume he die as result of the hanging what do act say act now this man purchase field with the wage of iniquity and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrail gush out act for it be write in the book of psalms let his dwelling place be desolate and let no one live in it and let another take his office here we may have graphic explanation of judas death so my line of reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re the two account of judas death be this matthew do not necessarily explain how judas die he do say judas hang himself but he do not specifically say judas die in the hang incident however act seem to show we his graphic demise therefore there be no contradiction between matthew and act re judas death my reply we do know from matthew that he do hang himself and act probably record his death although it be possible and plausible that he fall from the hanging and hit some rock thereby burst open can no long assume that to be the case therefore no contradiction matthew do not say judas die as result of the hanging do he most scholar believe he probably do but quote all that to show that highly regard the scholar explanation but in look at the text initially we can not assume judas die it be however highly probable db by the way while all agree that judas die from the hanging the book have different way of deal with the contradiction we be discuss one simply ignore it entirely and simply refer back to matthew version as the correct version in both matt and acts the biblical knowledge commentary suggest the hypothesis that judas hang and then when he rot his belly explode which do not explain his headlong fall or that his branch or rope break and he fall to his death and his gut gush out which do not explain how hang man would fall headlong rather than foot first my reply the outcome of any fall be dependent upon many factor how high the person be suspend before the fall any obstruction such as tree branch that may have deviate the fall how steep an incline of rocky surface the victim fall upon thus possibly roll or bounce of several rock etc in superficial examination of the acts passage and the matthew passage we be not give lot of info on the geographical specific but tony in the above quote post give we some possible reconstruction would be this judas hang himself on tree on the edge of precipice that overlook the valley of hinnom after he hang there for some time the limb of the tree snap or the rope give way and judas fall down the ledge mangle his body in the process the fall could have be before or after death as either would fit this explanation this possibility be entirely natural when the terrain of the valley of hinnom be examine from the bottom of the valley you can see rocky terrace to foot in height and almost perpendicular there be still tree around the ledge and rocky pavement at the bottom therefore it be easy to conclude that judas strike one of the jagged rock on this way down tear his body open db now truthfully do not see what be comfort about matthew confuse the source of the potter field prophesy but on the other hand the author be correct matthew do make that confusion of course biblical inerrantist who claim that every word of the bible be guarantee true by god will have to thereby add one more contradiction to the death of judas ie where the prophesy of the potter field come from my reply please when we be do with this study on his death remind to discuss this with you db as to your second question mr decenso you ask how we could be sure that the money with which judas purchase the land be indeed for the betrayal rather than some other source would point out that in acts where it specifically mention the reward of iniquity act it also specifically mention what act of iniquity they be talk about ie act concern judas who be guide to those who arrest jesus now would point out that when the bible describe an act of iniquity and then immediately discuss the reward of iniquity it would be rather inane to suggest that it be an action of iniquity other than the one discuss my reply dave we be get somewhere be not we act and in those day peter stand up in the midst of the disciple altogether the number of name be about hundred and twenty and say act man and brother this scripture have to be fulfil which the holy spirit speak before by the mouth of david concern judas who become guide act for he be number with we and obtain part in this ministry act now this man purchase field with the wage of iniquity and fall headlong he burst open in the middle and all his entrail gush out act and it become know to all those dwell in jerusalem so that field be call in their own language akel dama that be field of blood act for it be write in the book of psalms let his dwelling place be desolate and let no one live in it and let another take his office notice that in verse the word iniquity be not use rather it state that judas become guide to those who arrest jesus but the writer do not stop there vs for he be number with we and obtain part in this ministry what part do judas play in their ministry joh this he say not that he care for the poor but because he be thief and have the money box and he use to take what be put in it joh for some thought because judas have the money box that jesus have say to he buy those thing we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor so now we know what part judas play he be treasurer per se right after peter state that judas play part in this ministry treasurer accord to john then luke add the parenthetical explanation of wage of iniquity money that should have be put into the ministry but be steal by judas to purchase field believe this be well exegetical explanation of what the wage of iniquity be what do you think dave db now since have give you clear answer and even reference perhaps you could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you be instead of ask what type think you be as you do to mr joslin my reply will gladly admit that be complete inerrantist although do not have that big problem with the limited inerrancy view frank	['talk.religion.misc']

universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specify cause and effect seem to dictate at least to this layman mind there must be causal event no reasonable alternative exist would argue that causality be actually property of spacetime cause precede their effect and must concede here cause before effect imply time time be part of spacetime hense the argument would be valid could return and say that this do not infer the cause and effect relationship be unique address why which petri pikho address below also concede that be doubly remiss as assert no reasonable alternative exist an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated give time and further discovery by the scientist also understand that prove theory do not necessarily specify that this be how it happen but propose likely description of the phenomena in question be mistaken with this understanding but if you claim that there must be an answer to how do the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science have some good candidate for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith the fact that there be several candidate belie that none be conclusive with out conclusive evidence we be leave with faith it could even be argue that one of these hypothesis may one day be prove as good as non repeatable event can be prove but ask what hold someone today to the belief that any or all of they be correct except by faith couple of paragraph delete summary we ask why do the universe exist think this question should actually be split into two part namely why be there existence why anything exist and how do the universe emerge from nothing it be clear science have nothing to say about the first question however be it meaningful question after all would say it be not consider the following apparently it be for many person hence we have religion the question why anything exists can be counter by demand answer to question why there be nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both question turn out to be devoid of meaning thing that exist do and thing that do not exist do not exist tautology at its good carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first ask why while the second be request for definition it do not address why something do or do not exist but ask to define the lack of existence the second question be unanswerable indeed for how do we identify something as nothing be not they mutually exclusive term how do we identify state of non existence again this be near the limit of this simple layman ability to comprehend and would appreciate an explanation might add the worldview of thing that exist do and thing that don don be as ground in the realm of the non falsifiable as do the theist belief in god it be base on the assumption that there be not reason for be something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there be reason its very foundation exist in the same soil as that of one who claim there be reason we come to this either be therefore be or be for reason if the former be satisfactory answer then you be do for you be satisfied and need not doctor if the latter your search be just begin seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question time will tell some christians have talk to have say that actually god be himself the existence however see several problem with this answer first it inevitably lead to the conclusion that god be actually all existence good and evil devil and angel we and they this be pantheism not christianity agree it would lead to question their definition of christianity as well another answer be that god be the source of all existence this sound much well but be tempt to ask do god himself exist then if god be the source of his own existence it can only mean that he have in term of human time always exist but this be not the same as the source of all existence this do not preclude his existence it only seek to identify his quality imply he exist to have quality btw the good answer have hear be that human reasoning be incapable of understand such question be an atheist myself do not accept such answer since do not have any other method like the theist we come to statement of faith for this position assume that the evidence at hand be conclusive note be not argue against scientific endeavor for science be useful for understand the universe in which we exist but differ from the atheist in matter of perspective seek to understand what exist to understand and appreciate the art of the creator also have discover science be an inadequate tool to answer why it appear that pihko agree as we shall see but because tool be inadequate to answer question do not preclude the question assert that why be an invalid question do not provide an answer as far as can tell the very law of nature demand why that be not true of something outside of nature super natural this be not true science be collection of model tell we how not why something happen can not see any good reason why the why question would be bind only to natural thing assume that the supernatural domain exist if supernatural being exist it be as appropriate to ask why they do so as it be to ask why we exist my apology be use why as why do this come to be why do pre existence become existence why do pre spacetime become spacetime but we come to the admission that science fail to answer why because it can not be answer in the realm of modern science do that make the question invalid do not believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite have all of the part available just my opinion this opinion be also call vitalism namely that living system be somehow fundamentally different from inanimate system do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientist announce they have create primitive life say small bacteria in lab suppose we would do the same thing as when galileo or capernicus be vindicate before someone start jump up and down scream inquisition note say vindicate certainly hope we have get beyond the shoot the messenger stage pihko do present good point though we may need to ask what do as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shake by the production of evidence that shatter our sacred cow or will we seek to

repeat key cipher where the ciphertext be something like the plaintextor keykeykeykey and so on be call vigenere cipher if the key be not too long and the plaintext be in english do the following discover the length of the key by count coincidence see gaines sinkov try each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those byte which be equal if the two ciphertext portion have use the same key something over of the byte will be equal if they have use different key then less than will be equal assume random bit byte of key cover normal ascii text the small displacement which indicate an equal key be the length of the repeat key shift the text by that length andor it with itself this remove the key and leave you with textored with itself since english have about bit of real information per byte stream of textored together have bit of info per bit byte provide plenty of redundancy for choose unique decryption and in fact one stream of textored with itself have just bit per byte if the key be short it might be even easy to treat this as standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysis text show how to break those it be possible with those method in

to do ciphertext only attack on file encrypt with crypt one source for cbw be ftpcb how do use compression with encryption number of people have propose do perfect compression follow by some simple encryption methodor with repeat key unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact impossible to describe the typical english text beyond coarse characteristic such as single letter frequency you can build up more and more sophisticated model of your input but if the enemy have slightly more accurate model he will be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output have be design with cryptography in mind produce output that actually start off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compress begin with well know three byte magic number that can serve as an enter wedge for cryptanalysis this be not to say that compression before encryption be inherently bad idea it just have to be do very very carefully and by no mean remove the need for strong encryption compression after encryption be silly be there an unbreakable cipher yes the one time pad be unbreakable see part unfortunately the one time pad require secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext of course cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it need to be strong enough to resist attack by likely enemy for whatever length of time the datum it protect be expect to remain valid what do random mean in cryptography cryptographic application demand much more out of pseudorandom number generator than most application for source of bit to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bit will be give complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generate the stream and the sequence of through bit for all up to the lifetime of the source software generator also know as pseudo random have the function of expand truly random seed to long string of apparently random bit this seed must be large enough not to be guess by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhaps generate by hardware random number source those who have sparcstation workstation could for example generate random number use the audio input device as source of entropy by not connect anything to it for example cat dev audio compress foo give file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in it one can then encrypt that file use part of itself as key for example to convert that seed entropy into pseudo random string when look for hardware device to provide this entropy it be important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it look complicated to human it must be random for example disk operation completion time sound like they might be unpredictable to many people but spinning disk be much like clock and its output completion time be relatively low in entropy what be the unicity point unicity distance see the unicity distance be an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the corresponding source text and encryption key equal the number of ciphertext bit use ciphertext significantly long than this can be show probably to have unique decipherment this be use to back up claim of the validity of ciphertext only cryptanalysis ciphertext significantly shorter than this be likely to have multiple equally valid decryption and therefore to gain security unicity distance like all statistical or information theoretic measure do not make deterministic prediction but rather give probabilistic result namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it be likely that there be only single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible key be try for the decryption work cryptologist do not normally deal with unicity distance as such instead they directly determine the likelihood of event of interest let the unicity distance of cipher be character if few than ciphertext character have be intercept then there be not enough information to distinguish the real key from set of possible key des have unicity distance of character which be less than ciphertext block each block correspond to ascii character this may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance give no indication of the computational work require to find the key after approximately character have be intercept in fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceed along the line use in discuss unicity distance like other measure such as key size unicity distance be something that guarantee insecurity if it be too small but do not guarantee security if it be high few practical cryptosystem be absolutely impervious to analysis all manner of characteristic might serve as enter wedge to crack some cipher message however similar information theoretic consideration be occasionally useful for example to determine recommend key change interval for particular cryptosystem cryptanalyst also employ variety of statistical and information theoretic test to help guide the analysis in the most promising direction unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistic to cryptanalysis remain classify even the seminal work of alan turing see for some insight into the possibility see and what be key management and why be it important one of the fundamental axiom of cryptography be that the enemy be in full possession of the detail of the general cryptographic system and lack only the specific key datum employ in the encryption of course one would assume that the cia do not make habit of tell mossad about its cryptosystem but mossad probably find out anyway repeat use of finite amount of key provide redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially in modern communication system where vast amount of information be transfer both party must have not only sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refer to the distribution authentication and handling of key publicly accessible example of modern key management technology be the stu iii secure telephone unit which for classify use employ individual code crypto ignition keys and central key management center operate by nsa there be hierarchy in that certain cik be use by authorize cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic key and reporting of lose cik this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public key system there be several related issue many have to do with whom do you trust can use pseudo random or chaotic number as key stream chaotic equation and fractal produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generator perhaps the simple example be linear congruential sequence one of the most popular type of random number generator where there be no obvious dependence between seed and output unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in high enough dimension show up as regular lattice mathematically this lattice correspond to structure which be notoriously easy for cryptanalyst to exploit more complicated generator have more complicated structure which be why they make interesting pictures but cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see exercise and what be the correct frequency list for english letter there be three answer to this question each slightly deep than the one before you can find the first answer in various book namely frequency list compute directly from certain sample of english text of course any such list will be correctly compute but exactly which list you get depend on which sample be take the second answer be that the question do not make sense what do you mean by english letter the english language be not fix finite closed object that can be exactly characterize it have change over time it be different between different author any particular message will have different statistic from those of the language as whole the third answer be that yes no particular message be go to have exactly the same characteristic as english in general but for all reasonable statistical use these slight discrepancy will not matter in fact there be an entire field call bayesian statistic other buzzword be maximum entropy method and maximum likelihood estimation which study question like what be the chance that text with these letter frequency be in english and come up with reasonably robust answer so make your own list from your own sample of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what be the enigma for project in datum security we be look for source of information about the german enigma code and how it be break by the british during wwii see how do shuffle card card shuffling be special case of the permutation of an array of value use random or pseudo random function all possible output permutation of this process should be equally likely to do this you need random function modran which will produce uniformly distribute random integer in the interval give that function you can shuffle with the follow code assume arrlth be the length of array arr and swap interchange value at the two address give for swap arr modran arr modran can not be achieve exactly with simple ranno since ranno interval may not be divisible by although in most case the error will be very small to cover this case one can take ranno modulus mod call that number and if ranno return value less than go back and get another ranno value can foil pirate by encrypt my cd rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish cd rom with possibly multiple piece of software perhaps with each encrypt separately and will want to use different key for each user perhaps even good for only limited period of time in order to avoid piracy as far as we know this be impossible since there be nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identify the user at the keyboard if there be such an identification then the cd rom could be encrypt with key base in part on the one sell to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in this case the cd rom be one of kind and that defeat the intend purpose if the cd rom be to be encrypt once and then mass produce there must be key or set of key for that encryption produce at some stage in the process that key be useable with any copy of the cd rom datum the pirate need only

refer to the readme clkprog file for information on how these program work if you need to write one if you do develop such program the team would be interested in include it with future release if you be purchase new hardware for the purpose of use it be suggest that you purchase an base board such as the orchid prodesigner iis avoid recent diamond board will not work with they because diamond will not provide programming detail in fact the project be actively not support new diamond product as long as such policy remain in effect contribution of code will not be accept because of the potential liability if you would like to see this change tell diamond about it some people have ask if would work with local bus orisa video card theoretically the mean of communication between the cpu and the video card be irrelevant to compatibility it could be isaisa or local bus what should matter be the chipset on the video card unfortunately the developer do not have lot of access toisa orlb machine so this be largely an untested theory however we have yet to see any report of thing not work on one of these bus and we have several report of work fine on they what about accelerated board at this

be four such plane the mit frame buffer code be not design to deal with this ifga handle color mode by pack bit pixel into each byte the mit code could be modify to support this or it already may be not sure but for thega way of do thing complete new frame buffer implementation be require some beta tester be look into this but nothing be yet available from the project what other hardware or

ansiccoption this be something that be add to allow developer to get rid of the ansi ness define in the default ccoptions without have to rewrite the entire ccoptions line for example with stock mit you would see something like ccoptions ansiwritable string and to get rid of the ansi ness the developer would have to put ccoptionswritable string in his imakefile with this change you would see default of ansiccoption ansi ccoptionswritable string and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile be ansiccoption with ansi the effect be even more dramatic in practice because ccoptions

difference be due to software driver fast be misname for bit in mode see for detail device per scsi controller in mode be fully compliant and bit tend to be implement as very fast since it do not require the different controller interface in hardware and software that and bit do transfer speed be with burst bit with burst bit and with burst bit wide and fast since bit can use software driver and hardware at bit speed and as such be limit to device sometimes it be mistakenly call fast bit fast require software driver and electronic but can still use the port wide bit and bit require different scsi port electronic and software driver from which make they more expensive than other scsi interface mac scsi asynchronous build in standard since the plus even though apple develop some specification for scsi controler the os scsi manager need to be rewrite to take full advantage of the feature of both scsi interface as result present macs use bit as fast asynchronous presently quadras be the only macs with controller chip build in digital review oct though they lack some other part of the hardware like the wide port interface since other macs require nubus card to use old nubus macs have bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus and cpu rumor some cyclone macs june will come with wide fast port standard and have rewrite os scsi manager ibm scsi be not too wide spread yet generally not bundle with system except as add onisa and vesa local bus adapter avalable like the mac bit be use as very fast by most controller out there unlike the mac ibm have no exact scsi controller specification which result in add incompatibility for scsi mac memory expansion with few exception the mac have use non parity pin bit simm memory expansion since the plus while pin bit parity simm could be use in these macs only special iicis could make use of the parity feature by convension both simm type be call pin simm the iifx use pin parity simm the lc iii and all use new pin simm that be accessable by bit at time and be use in ibm the mac do complete memory check at startup by write read every memory location if something be seriously wrong with simm the mac will not boot and give sound chord indicate what the problem be since macs make before feb manage memory bace on data path simms have to be instal in pair bit or in set of bit the centris and quadra eliminate this with new memory management setup that allow memory to be upgrade one simm at time if the simm be the same size be use then the memory be interleave across the two simm result in performance boost on

bent those who live immediately after the flood such as noah ham his son cush and his son nimrod have much strong appreciation of divine wrath they also have strong understanding of the true god in fact this immediacy be cause of hardship for some so much so that atlas who be see with heaven rest on his shoulder but this be not merely the physical heaven that he be lift it be to put god and the strict spirituality of his law at distance and thus he become the elevator of the heaven this god make man able to feel as if heaven be afar off and as if either the god of heaven could not see through the dark cloud or do not regard with displeasure the breaker of his law it be interesting to see that it be that be title emancipator or deliverer or phoroneus it be nimrod who invade the patriarchal system and abridge the liberty of mankind yet be worship for having give many benefit he be deliverer all right but not as we think of christ as deliverer one deliver from conscious feeling of god wrath the other actually perform delivery from gods wrath and it be up to we to accept it as true do not see the problem from the time of adam those who look forward to the come anointed one and put their faith in the fact that it be god who be to do the provision be account as righteous but up to the crucifixion their sin be only cover not take away therefore the dispensation of the church view the accountability of sin the same but see it as complete action rom make it clear that it have always be salvation via faith and nothing else understand what you be try to convey but do not think would lay hold of it because the scripture doquate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of say the church ruling with christn tell we what eternal life be exactly as you be correct that it be much more than non cessation of consciousness it depend upon your def of lose the elect be lose only in time as outside of time they have be choose from the foundation of the world existentially we be all bear lose but the righteous be in christ and therefore never assuredly lose maybe this summer could find time to put together paper on it simply have to buy more book for myself and these old book be very expensive either that or countless trip to the oriental museum could not agree with you more our understanding of say eschatology be clearly clear than that of say isaiah but that be not what be refer to no understand it as you have say this be my point ah this be it this be the big question however would say again think that the good lie be one

if they reveal that private side that be why it be so hard to bring their teaching this think the primary object of the mystery be to introduce privately little by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it would not have be safe to openly profess be the true religion case in point today might be the masons just note that they too worship osiris in egypt who can be trace to nimrod the husband son no disagree with you here gerry know what you be allude to in that the church primarily the rcc do endorse aristotelian philosophy into their worldview but would disagree with you that it originate in greece if you be student of history you will come to see that much of what greece come to expound to the world as their original be just an adulteration of that which they

he be about year old when he die in may he have bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he develop his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while try to develop way to compute chemical property base only on the element use larson lack of fancy ph degree might be one reason that orthodox physicist be ignore he but it be not valid reason sometimes it take relative outsider time it be clear from his book that he also know orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradiction ad hoc assumption principles of impotence in consistencies etc larson do not have the fund etc to experimentally test his theory and it be not necessary for he to do so he simply compare the various part of his theory with other researcher experimental and observational datum and in many case his explanation fit better self consistent theory be much more than the orthodox physicist and astronomer have they claim to be look for unified field theory that work but have be ignore one for over year now modern physics do not explain the physical universe so well some part of some of

which quickly disintegrate like cosmic ray because they be incompatible with their environment large and more expensive collider will only create few more element of anti matter that the physicist

should be name after lead particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter be not simple case of opposite charge of the same type of particle it have more photon of which they be make in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalent of the speed of light which larson call unit velocity and the natural datum in larson theory positron be actually particle of matter not anti matter when positron and electron meet the rotational vibration charge and rotation of their respective photon of which they be make neutralize each other in larson theory the anti matter half of the physical universe have three dimension of time and only one dimension of space and exist in reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury have be observe and precisely measure to advance at the rate of second of arc per century second of this advance be attribute via calculation to gravitational perturbation from the other planet venus earth jupiter etc the remain second of arc be be use to help prove einstein general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey larson achieve result close to the second than general relativity can by instead use special relativity in one or more of his book he apply the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally reject general relativity as another mathematical fantasy he also reject most of special relativity include the part about mass increase near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shift those quasar with red shift great than really be move fast than the speed of light although most of that motion be away from we in time in larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there be three dimension of time instead of only one but two of those dimension can not be measure dimension that we can measure be the clock time at low relative speed the value of the other two dimension be negligible but at high speed they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be use as fudge factor larson often use the term coordinate time when write about this in regard to mass increase it have be prove in atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration be acceleration force mass orthodox physicist be ignore the third factor force in larson theory mass stays constant and force drop toward zero force be actually motion or combinations of motions or relation between motions include inward and outward scalar motions the expansion of the universe for example be an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not result of the so call big bang which be yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey larson north pacific publishers box portland oregon page indexed hardcover it contain the astrophysical portion of general unified theory of the physical universe develop by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty year ago it contain final solution to most all astrophysical mystery include the formation of galaxy binary and multiple star system and solar system the true origin of the degree background radiation cosmic ray and gamma ray burst and the true nature of quasar pulsar white dwarfs explode galaxy etc it contain what astronomer and astrophysicist be all look for if they be ready to seriously consider it with open mind the follow be an example of his theory success in his first book in the structure of the physical universe larson predict the existence of exploding galaxy several year before astronomer start find they they be necessary consequence of larson comprehensive theory and when quasars be discover he have an immediate related explanation for they also gamma ray bursts astro physicist and astronomer be still scratch their head about the mysterious gamma ray bursts they be originally think to originate from neutron star in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit have be detect they in all direction uniformly and their source location in space do not correspond to any know object except for few case of directional coincidence gamma ray burst be necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe develop by the late physicist dewey larson accord to page of his book the universe of motion publish in the gamma ray burst be come from supernova explosion in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson call the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material half of the physical universe and the way they be connect together the gamma ray burst can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this be why the source location of the burst do not correspond with know object and come from all direction uniformly wonder how close to we in space source location would have to be for gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinction of the past which be now be blame on impact of comet and asteroid be actually cause by nearby gamma ray bursts larsonian binary star formation about half of all the star in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun be binary or double but orthodox astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there be so many of they but binary star system be actually likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe develop by the late physicist dewey larson will try to summarize larsons explanation which be detail in chapter of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other book first of all accord to larson star do not generate energy by fusion small fraction come from slow gravitational collapse the rest result from the complete annihilation of heavy element heavy than iron each element have destructive temperature limit the heavy the element be the low be this limit star internal temperature increase as it grow in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray gradually reach the destructive temperature limit of light and light element when the internal temperature of the star reach the destructive temperature limit of iron there be type supernova explosion this be because there be so much iron present and that be relate to the structure of iron atom and the atom building process which larson explain in some of his book well than can when the star explode the light material on the outer portion of the star be blow outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavy material in the center portion of the star be already bounce around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion push that material over the speed of light and it expand outward in time which be equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappear for while over long period of time both masse start to fall back gravitationally the material that have be blow outward in space now start to form red giant star the material that have be blow outward in time start to form white dwarf star both star then start move back toward the main sequence from opposite direction on the diagram the chance of the two masse fall back into the exact same location in space make single lone star again be near zero they will instead form binary system orbit each other accord to larson white dwarf star have an inverse density gradient be dense at its surface because the material at its center be most widely disperse blow outward in time this eliminate the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the explode star be relatively small then instead of single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf star revolve around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affect by its heat etc these will become planets in chapter of the universe of motion larson use all this information and other principle of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode law black hole fantasy hear that physicist stephen hawking recently complete theoretical mathematical analysis of two black hole merge together into single black hole and conclude that the new black hole would have more mas than the sum of the two original black hole such result should be recognize by everyone as red flag cause widespread doubt about the whole idea of black hole etc after read physicist dewey larson book about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book the universe of motion it be clear to that black hole be nothing more than mathematical fantasies the strange object at cygnus be just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomer and physicist so badly want by the way do not understand why so much publicity be be give to physicist stephen hawking the physicist and astronomer seem to be act as if hawking severe physical problem somehow make he wiser it do not wish the same attention have be give to physicist dewey larson while he be still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be give to larson theory book and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion hear of that concept many year ago in connection with ufo and unorthodox inventor but never be able to find out how or why they work or how they be construct find possible clue about why they might work on page of the book basic property of matter by the late physicist dewey larson which describe part of larson comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe quote one paragraph as indicate in the precede chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrive at totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electron we find be derive from the environment it be bring out in volume larson book nothing but motion that there be physical process in operation which produce electron in substantial quantity and that although the motion that constitute these electron be in many case absorb by atomic structure the opportunity for utilize this type of motion in such structure be limited it follow that there be always large excess of free electron in the material sector material half of the universe most of which be uncharged in this uncharged state the electron can not move with respect to extension space because they be inherently rotate unit of space and the relation of space to space be not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remain permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon be carry outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material

faith on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line be truth regardless of popularity of opinion also find it rather strange that in try to persuade that create and eternally existent be equivalent you say grant the mormon belief you can not grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have be address in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that be raise and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant the bible state that lucifer be create the bible state that jesus be the creator of all the contradiction that we have be that the lds belief be that jesus and lucifer be the same ra your point that we all be brother of jesus and lucifer be also ra heretical since we be not innately brother and sister of christ ra we be adopt for ye have not receive the spirit of bondage ra again to fear but ye have receive the spirit of adoption whereby ra we cry abba father romans and not the natural child ra of god it be only through faith that we even enter the family of ra god for ye be all the child of god by faith in christ jesus ra galatians and it be only through the manifestation of this ra faith in receive jesus that we be become the son of god but ra as many as receive he to they give he power to become the son of ra god even to they that believe on his name which be bear not ra of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but ra of god john ra ra have it occur to you robert that be bear of someone or be ra of that person or person family may be symbolic term in the new ra testament mormon believe that we be adopt into the house of ra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have express ra belief that this do evince physical change in our body the mormon belief be that all be child of god literally there be nothing symbolic about it this however contradict what the bible say the bible teach that not everyone be child of god the field be the world the good seed be the child of the kingdom but the tare be the child of the wicked one matthew speak that which have see with my father and ye do that which ye have see with your father john ye do the deed of your father then say they to he we be not bear of fornication we have one father even god jesus say unto they if god be your father ye would love for proceed forth and come from god neither come of myself but he send why do ye not understand my speech even because ye can not hear my word ye be of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he be murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there be no truth in he when he speaketh lie he speaketh of his own for he be liar and the father of it john and say full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease wherein in time past ye walk accord to the course of this world accord to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the child of disobedience ephesian in this the child of god be manifest and the child of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness be not of god neither he that loveth not his brother john one become child of god but as many as receive he to they give he power to become the son of god even to they that believe on his name john behold what manner of love the father hath bestow upon we that we should be call the son of god therefore the world knoweth we not because it know he not beloved now be we the son of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like he for we shall see he as he be john when he be bear again through faith in jesus christ which be bear not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god john having predestinate we unto the adoption of child by jesus christ to himself accord to the good pleasure of his will ephesians of his own will begat he we with the word of truth that we should be kind of firstfruit of his creature james for as many as be lead by the spirit of god they be the son of god for ye have not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we be the child of god romans beloved let we love one another for love be of god and every one that loveth be bear of god and knoweth god john whosoever believeth that jesus be the christ be bear of god and every one that loveth he that begat loveth he also that be begotten of he john for ye be all the child of god by faith in christ jesus galatians ra we be tell that and this be life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast send ra john life eternal be to know the only true god yet the ra doctrine of the lds that have mention portray vastly ra different jesus jesus that can not be reconcile with the jesus of ra the bible they be so far remove from each other that to proclaim ra one as be true deny the other from be true accord to the ra bible eternal life be dependent on know the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination ra ra ra robert with all due respect who die and leave you chief arbiter of ra correct biblical interpretation do not mean to benotty about this ra but the fact be that the bible be so differently interpret by different ra group of biblical scholar what do you think of the jehovah ra witness for example that to make reference to the jesus of the ra bible be simply ridiculous whose jesus of the bible do you mean this be really red herring it do not address any issue raise but rather it seek to obfuscate the fact that some group try to read something into the bible do not change what the bible teach for example the fact that the jehovah witness deny the deity of christ do not alter what the bible teach look for that bless hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ titus peter servant and an apostle of jesus christ to they that have obtain like precious faith with we through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ peter on the deity of christ we first look to the bible to see what it teach to discount or not even address what the bible teach because there be some group that have differ view be self defeat to see what the bible teach you have to look at the bible ra our lord mortality be essential to his own salvation the ra promise messiah he have to work out his own salvation by ra do the will of the father in all thing ibid he have ra to be baptize to gain admission to the celestial kingdom mormon ra doctrine ra ra welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert the ra above book be by the late bruce mcconkie former general authority ra of the lds church those book be not publish by the church nor do ra they constitute offical doctrine they consist of his opinion now ra do that mean that what he say be not true not at all will have to ra think about the idea of christ personal salvation before come to any ra conclusion myself the conclusion come to may seem heretical to ra you but be prepared to accept that find this rather curious when mention that the mormon belief be that jesus need to be save put forward some quote from the late apostle bruce mcconkie the curious part be that no one address the issue of jesus need to be save rick come the close with his have my own conclusion to address the point most of the other reply have instead hop scotch to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his view be official doctrine do not think that it matter if mcconkie view be canon that be not the issue be mcconkie writing indicative of mormon belief on this subject be the real issue the indication from rick be that they may certainly be robert weiss	['talk.religion.misc']
